<title>What I'm doing now</title>
<h1>Now</h1>

<div>

<div>
<h2 id="october-4-2024">October 4, 2024</h2>
<p>Update: I live in Boston now!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nectry got an office in Cambridge. We are now stationed at <a href="https://www.aethos.org/">Aethos</a>. I am enjoying lots of free
lattes, delivered instantly to me by a machine! The wonders of
technology! Though I do often miss Loud Baby, the tiny cafe across the
street from where I lived in Brooklyn.</li>
<li>I scrambled to find an apartment.</li>
<li>I abandoned my plans to go to Mammoth, Washington, the Bay Area‚Ä¶
SPLASH in two weeks is still on though! See you in Pasadena!</li>
<li>I bought some furniture. It‚Äôs an investment, and a way to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm
here to stay for a while.‚Äù - I went to <a href="https://nepls.org/Events/34/">NEPLS</a>, which was really fun! I
finally met Shriram Krishnamurthi, Will Crichton, and Ragit Nigam.</li>
<li>I finally finished Dune and watched the first movie. Can‚Äôt wait to
watch the second‚Ä¶ and the 1984 one. But I‚Äôm waiting for the moment to be
right. I will know it when it comes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Boston has been very good to me so far. I expect to stay here, bar
temporary absences, for about 6-8 years. If you find yourself in Boston
before 2032, shoot me a message! Or put another way, if you want to
experience me still in my 20s, you‚Äôll have to come to Boston.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing fully in where I am and what I‚Äôm doing right now.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="august-14-2024">August 14, 2024</h2>
<p>Late summer.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm still working at Nectry. We are slowly growing our engineering
team and it has been wonderful to welcome Jackson to the company.</p>

<p>What has transpired:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visited Liz and Devin in Philadelphia‚Äîmy first time in the City of
    Brotherly Love.
        <ul>
            <li>We should bring back dueling professors for their jobs. I beat <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</a> at
            board games in her own home; this should entitle me to a tenure-track
            appointment.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
<li><a href="/assets/img/now/cartwheel2.jpg">Cartwheel</a> found a
home with Rana in Berkeley.</li>
<li>I saw the <a href="https://twitter.com/JanPaul123/status/1815502582015754657">mind-boggling
    cutting edge of serverless computing with LLMs</a> at <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a> HQ with <a href="https://janpaulposma.nl/">JP Posma</a> and <a href="https://stevekrouse.com">Steve Krouse</a>.</li>
<li>I learned to walk without rhythm.</li>
<li>Finally met <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/">Geoffrey</a> in
person, at <a href="https://www.southparkcommons.com/">South Park
Commons</a> where he gave an excellent keynote on malleable software in
<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/patchwork/notebook/">Patchwork</a>.
    <ul>
    <li>I also got to meet <a href="https://www.todepond.com/">Lu Wilson</a>
    and <a href="https://thesephist.com/">Linus Lee</a>, and the lovely
    folks at <a href="https://websim.ai/">Websim</a>.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Gave a talk for the students at <a href="https://fractalbootcamp.com/">Fractal Bootcamp</a>.</li>
<li>I moved out of my Brooklyn apartment and went back home to Los
Angeles.</li>
<li>Visited my cousins in Colorado, where I experienced the excitement of Boulder thunderstorms and the joy of family reunion.</li>
</ul>

<p>What‚Äôs next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending time with family!</li>
<li>Driving around the West Coast!
<ul><li>Mammoth Lakes!</li></ul></li>
<li>Volunteering at <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> in Pasadena!</li>
<li><a href="/garden/books.html">Reading</a>, <a href="/tidings/">writing</a>!</li>
<li>Likely returning to Boston soon, to stay for a while!</li>
</ul>

<h2>April 23, 2024</h2>
        
<p>It has been 7 months since my last confession.</p>
<p>I intended to write an update in late January or early February, but
I got frustrated with the bespoke ad hoc templating system I was using
to generate this website and I spent a while redesigning that at a
leisurely pace. Now it is completed and I can actually focus on the
content!</p>
<p>So, here‚Äôs what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I graduated from Columbia with my Bachelor of Arts in Computer
Science and Mathematics.</li>
<li>I was admitted to some PhD programs in computer science.</li>
<li>I moved to Brooklyn.</li>
<li>I started my new job at <a href="https://nectry.com/">Nectry</a>.</li>
<li>I went to <a href="/assets/img/now/epfl.png">Switzerland</a>.</li>
<li>I accepted my offer of admission to MIT‚Äôs CS PhD program. I‚Äôll be
deferring for one year, to start in Fall 2025.</li>
<li>I got a <a href="/assets/img/now/cartwheel.jpg">cat</a> (okay, I‚Äôm
<em>fostering</em> a cat).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the horizon:</p>
<ul>
<li>NJPLS at NYU.</li>
<li>Walking at graduation.</li>
<li>Summer in New York! <a href="https://queensnightmarket.com/">Queen‚Äôs
Night Market</a>, <a href="https://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a>, <a href="https://nitehawkcinema.com/">the Nitehawk</a>, and all good things
in the sun.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>September 28, 2023</h2>
        <p>
            Seventh (and final?) semester of undergrad. I am loaded up with classes, so I
            don't have much time for research and personal projects.
            Instead, my focus is on my coursework:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning language design in a seminar with <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/">Bjarne Stroustrup</a></li>
            <li>Working as a teaching assistant for both formal
                verification and parallel functional programming</li>
            <li>Studying point-set topology and algebraic topology at the same time,
                for some reason</li>
            <li>And a few classes for fun and core requirements: fiction
                writing, Judaism and Israeli cinema</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's a busy schedule, but quite exhilarating.
            Today I led our language design seminar in a discussion of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/234286.1057828">Alan Kay's
                HOPL paper on Smalltalk</a>&mdash;a paper which led to some
            powerful epiphanies about object-oriented design, end-user
            programming, and computer science education.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've found the time to binge-watch the first two seasons of <i>Community</i>.
            It seems everyone has seen it already, but this party is so great I
            have no qualms being late to it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Plans on the horizon: a couple of trips around
        the Northeast, including <a href="https://www.njpls.org/nov2023.html">NJPLS</a>; grad school
        applications; graduation; seeing my dogs back home.
