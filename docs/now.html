<p>It has been 7 months since my last confession.</p>
<p>I intended to write an update in late January or early February, but
I got frustrated with the bespoke ad hoc templating system I was using
to generate this website and I spent a while redesigning that at a
leisurely pace. Now it is completed and I can actually focus on the
content!</p>
<p>So, here’s what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I graduated from Columbia with my Bachelor of Arts in Computer
Science and Mathematics.</li>
<li>I was admitted to some PhD programs in computer science.</li>
<li>I moved to Brooklyn.</li>
<li>I started my new job at <a href="https://nectry.com/">Nectry</a>.</li>
<li>I went to <a href="/assets/img/now/epfl.png">Switzerland</a>.</li>
<li>I accepted my offer of admission to MIT’s CS PhD program. I’ll be
deferring for one year, to start in Fall 2025.</li>
<li>I got a <a href="/assets/img/now/cartwheel.jpg">cat</a> (okay, I’m
<em>fostering</em> a cat).</li>
</ul>
<p>On the horizon:</p>
<ul>
<li>NJPLS at NYU.</li>
<li>Walking at graduation.</li>
<li>Summer in New York! <a href="https://queensnightmarket.com/">Queen’s
Night Market</a>, <a href="https://www.smorgasburg.com/">Smorgasburg</a>, <a href="https://nitehawkcinema.com/">the Nitehawk</a>, and all good things
in the sun.</li>

        <h3>September 28, 2023</h3>
        <p>
            Seventh (and final?) semester of undergrad. I am loaded up with classes, so I
            don't have much time for research and personal projects.
            Instead, my focus is on my coursework:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning language design in a seminar with <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/">Bjarne Stroustrup</a></li>
            <li>Working as a teaching assistant for both formal
                verification and parallel functional programming</li>
            <li>Studying point-set topology and algebraic topology at the same time,
                for some reason</li>
            <li>And a few classes for fun and core requirements: fiction
                writing, Judaism and Israeli cinema</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's a busy schedule, but quite exhilarating.
            Today I led our language design seminar in a discussion of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/234286.1057828">Alan Kay's
                HOPL paper on Smalltalk</a>&mdash;a paper which led to some
            powerful epiphanies about object-oriented design, end-user
            programming, and computer science education.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've found the time to binge-watch the first two seasons of <i>Community</i>.
            It seems everyone has seen it already, but this party is so great I
            have no qualms being late to it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Plans on the horizon: a couple of trips around
        the Northeast, including <a href="https://www.njpls.org/nov2023.html">NJPLS</a>; grad school
        applications; graduation; seeing my dogs back home.
