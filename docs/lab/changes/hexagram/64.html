<title>䷿  Hexagram 64. Wei Chi / Before Completion</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME<br>
         below K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram indicates a time when the transition from disorder to
    order is not yet completed. The change is indeed prepared for, since
all    the lines in the upper trigram are in relation to those in the lower.
However,     they are not yet in their places. While the preceding hexagram
offers an   analogy to autumn, which forms the transition from summer to
winter, this   hexagram presents a parallel to spring, which leads out of
winter's stagnation   into the fruitful time of summer. With this hopeful
outlook the Book of Changes   come to its close.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  BEFORE COMPLETION. Success.<br>
         But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,<br>
         Gets his tail in the water,</p>
                         
  <p>  There is nothing that would further.</p>
                         
  <p>  The conditions are difficult. The task is great and full of responsibility.
    It is nothing less than that of leading the world out of confusion back
  to  order. But it is a task that promises success, because there is a goal
  that  can unite the forces now tending in different directions. At first,
  however,  one must move warily, like an old fox walking over ice. The caution
  of a fox walking over ice is proverbial in China. His ears are constantly
  alert to the cracking of the ice, as he carefully and circumspectly searches
  out the safest spots. A young fox who as yet has not acquired this caution
  goes ahead boldly, and it may happen that he falls in and gets his tail
wet  when he is almost across the water. Then of course his effort has been
all  in vain. Accordingly, in times "before completion," deliberation and
caution   are the prerequisites of success.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Fire over water:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of the condition before transition.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man is careful<br>
         In the differentiation of things,</p>
                         
  <p>  So that each finds its place.</p>
                         
  <p>  When fire, which by nature flames upward, is above, and water, which
    flows downward, is below, their effects take opposite directions and
remain     unrelated. If we wish to achieve an effect, we must first investigate
the    nature of the forces in question and ascertain their proper place.
If we   can bring these forces to bear in the right place, they will have
the desired    effect and completion will be achieved. But in order to handle
 external  forces  properly, we must above all arrive at the correct standpoint
 ourselves,  for  only from this vantage can we work correctly.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He gets his tail in the water.<br>
         Humiliating.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of disorder there is a temptation to advance oneself as rapidly
    as possible in order to accomplish something tangible. But this enthusiasm
    leads only to failure and humiliation if the time for achievement has
not    yet arrived. In such time it is wise to spare ourselves the opprobrium
 of   failure by holding back.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He brakes his wheels.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here again the time to act has not yet come. But the patience needed
    is not that of idle waiting without thought of the morrow. Kept up indefinitely,
    this would not lead to any success. Instead, an individual must develop
  in  himself the strength that will enable him to go forward. He must have
  a vehicle,  as it were, to effect the crossing. But he must for the time
 being use the  brakes. Patience in the highest sense means putting brakes
 on strength. Therefore  he must not fall asleep and lose sight of the goal.
 If he remains strong and steadfast in his resolve, all goes well in the
end.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Before completion, attack brings misfortune.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.</p>
                         
  <p>  The time of transition has arrived, but one lacks the strength to
complete the transition. If one should attempt to force it, disaster would
result, because collapse would then be unavoidable. What is to be done? A
new situation must be created; one must engage the energies of able helpers
and in this fellowship take the decisive step-cross the great water. Then
completion will become possible.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country.<br>
         For three years, great realms are rewarded.</p>
                         
  <p>  Now it is the time of struggle. The transition must be completed.
We must make ourselves strong in resolution; this brings good fortune. All
misgivings that might arise in such grave times of struggle must be silenced.
It is a question of a fierce battle to break and to discipline the Devil's
Country, the forces of decadence. But the struggle also has its reward. Now
is the time to lay the foundations of power and mastery for the future.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  No remorse.</p>
                         
  <p>  The light of the superior man is true.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The victory has been won. The power of steadfastness has not been
routed. Everything has gone well. All misgivings have been overcome. Success
has justified the deed. The light of a superior personality shines forth
anew and makes its influence felt among men who have faith in it and rally
around it. The new time has arrived, and with it good fortune. And just as
the sun shines forth in redoubled beauty after rain, or as a forest grows
more freshly green from charred ruins after a fire, so the new era appears
all the more glorious by contrast with the misery of the old.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  There is drinking of wine<br>
         In genuine confidence. No blame.<br>
         But if one wets his head,<br>
         He loses it, in truth.</p>
                         
  <p>  Before completion, at the dawning of the new time, friends foregather
    in an atmosphere of mutual trust, and the time of waiting is passed in
 conviviality.   Since the new era is hard on the threshold, there is no
blame  in this. But   one must be careful in all this to keep within proper
bounds.  If in his exuberance  a man gets drunk, he forfeits the favorableness
of the situation through his intemperance.</p>
