<title>䷑  Hexagram 18. Ku / Work on what has been spoiled [ Decay ]</title>

<p id="alternative">
</p>

<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  Kên  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  Sun  THE GENTLE, WIND</p>
                         
  <p>  The Chinese character ku represents a bowl in whose contents worms
    are breeding. This means decay. IT is come about because the gentle indifference
    in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the
upper,     and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions
 embody   a demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram
 is not  simply "what has been spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled".</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED<br>
         Has supreme success.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
         Before the starting point, three days.<br>
         After the starting point, three days.</p>
                         
  <p>  What has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again through
    man's work. IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that
   has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom.
   Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the
possibilities    of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-symbolized
by crossing    of the great water-but must take hold energetically. Success
depends, however,    on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines,
"Before the starting    point, three days. After the starting point, three
days." We must first  know  the cause of corruption before we can do away
with them; hence it is  necessary  to be cautious during the time before
the start. Then we must see to it that  the new way is safely entered upon,
so that a relapse may be avoided; therefore  we must pay attention to the
time after the start. Decisiveness and energy  must take the place of inertia
and indifference that have led to decay, in  order that the ending may be
followed by a new beginning. </p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  The wind blows low on the mountain:<br>
         The image of DECAY.<br>
         Thus the superior man stirs up the people<br>
         And strengthens their spirit.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the wind blow s slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils
    the vegetation. This contains a challenge to improvement. It is the same
   with debasing attitudes and fashions; they corrupt human society. His
methods    likewise must be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a
way that their   effects unfold in orderly sequence. The superior must first
remove stagnation   by stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs up everything,
and must  strengthen and tranquilize the character of the people, as the
mountain gives  tranquillity and nourishment to all that grows in its vicinity.

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six in the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
         If there is a son, <br>
         No blame rests upon the departed father. <br>
         Danger. In the end good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Rigid adherence to tradition has resulted in decay. But the decay
has not yet penetrated deeply and so can still be easily remedied. It is
as if a son were compensated for the decay his father allowed to creep in.
Then no blame attaches to the father. However, one must not overlook the
danger or take the matter too lightly. Only if one is conscious of the danger
connected with every reform will everything go well in the end. </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother.<br>
         One must not be too persevering.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to mistakes that as a result of weakness have brought
about decay-hence the symbol, "what has been spoiled by the mother. " In
setting things right in such a case, a certain gentle consideration is called
for. In order not to wound, one should not attempt to proceed too drastically.
      </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
         There will be a little remorse. No great blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a man who proceeds a little too energetically in righting
    the mistakes of the past. Now and then, as a result, minor discourse
and    annoyances will surely develop. But too much energy is better than
too little.   Therefore, although he may at times have slight cause for regret,
he remains   free of any serious blame. </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
         In continuing one sees humiliation.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  This shows the situation of someone too weak to take measures against
    decay that has its roots in the past and is just beginning to manifest
 itself.   It is allowed to run its course. If this continues, humiliation
 will result.     </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>   Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
         One meets with praise.</p>
                         
  <p>  An individual is confronted with corruption originating from neglect
    in former times. He lacks the power to ward it off alone, but with able
  helpers  he can at least bring about a thorough reform, if he cannot create
  a new beginning, and this also is praiseworthy.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He does not serve kings and princes,<br>
         Sets himself higher goals.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  Not every man has an obligation to mingle in the affairs of the world.
    There are some who are developed to such a degree that they are justified
    in letting the world go its own way and refusing to enter public life
with    a view to reforming it. But this does not imply a right to remain
idle or   to sit back and merely criticize. Such withdrawal is justified
only when  we strive to realize in ourselves the higher aims of mankind.
For although   the sage remains distant from the turmoil of daily life, he
creates incomparable    human values for the future. </p>
