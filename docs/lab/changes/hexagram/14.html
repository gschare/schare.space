  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME<br>
         below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                         
  <p>  The fire in heaven above shines far, and all things stand out in the
    light and become manifest. The weak fifth line occupies the place of
honor     and all the strong lines are in accord with it.All things come
to the man    who is modest and kind in a high position.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.</p>
                         
  <p>  Supreme success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions
    great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is
it   possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast
and to  possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time
is favorable--a   time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power
 is expressing   itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme
 success and wealth.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Fire in heaven above:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.<br>
         Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,<br>
         And thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.</p>
                         
  <p>  The sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth,
    is the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this
sort    must be administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good
into the    light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor
and promote    the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent
will of God, who   desires only good and not evil.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  No relationship with what is harmful;<br>
         There is no blame in this.<br>
         If one remains conscious of difficulty,<br>
         One remains without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Great possession that is still in its beginnings and that has not
yet been challenged brings no blame, since there has been no opportunity
to make mistakes. Yet there are many difficulties to be overcome. It is only
by remaining conscious of theses difficulties that one can keep inwardly
free of possible arrogance and wastefulness, and thus in principle overcome
all cause for blame.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A big wagon for loading.<br>
         One may undertake something.<br>
         No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Great possession consists not only in the quantity of goods at one's
    disposal, but first and foremost, in their mobility and utility, for
then     they can be used in undertakings, and we remain free of embarrassment
and    mistakes. The big wagon, which will carry a heavy load and in which
one  can  journey farm means that there are at hand able helpers who give
their  support  t and are equal to their task. One can load great responsibility
  upon such  persons, and this is necessary in important undertakings.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven.<br>
         A petty man cannot do this.</p>
                         
  <p>  A magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what he possesses
    as his exclusive personal property , but should place it at the disposal
   of the ruler or of the people at large. In so doing, he takes the right
 attitude   toward his possession, which as private property can never endure.
 A petty   man is incapable of this. He is harmed by great possessions, because
 instead   of sacrificing them, he would keep them for himself.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He makes a difference<br>
         Between himself and his neighbor.<br>
         No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  This characterizes the position of a man placed among rich and powerful
    neighbors. It is a dangerous position. He must look neither to the right
   nor to the left, and must shun envy and the temptation to vie with others.
   In this way he remains free of mistakes.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified,<br>
         Has good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation is very favorable. People are being won not by coercion
    but by unaffected sincerity, so that they are attached to us in sincerity
    and truth. However, benevolence alone is not sufficient at the time of
 POSSESSION   IN GREAT MEASURE. For insolence might begin to spread. Insolence
 must be  kept in bounds by dignity; then good fortune is assured.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He is blessed by heaven.<br>
         Good fortune.<br>
         Nothing that does not further.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the fullness of possession and at the height of power, one remains
    modest and gives honor to the sage who stands outside the affairs of
the    world. By this means one puts oneself under the beneficent influence
descending    form heaven, and all goes well. Confucius says of this line:</p>
                         
  <p>  To bless means to help. Heaven helps the man who is devoted; men help
    the man who is true. He who walks in truth and is devoted in his thinking,
    and furthermore reveres the worthy, is blessed by heaven. He has good
fortune,    and there is nothing that would not further.</p>
