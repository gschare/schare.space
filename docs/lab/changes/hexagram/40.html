<title>䷧  Hexagram 40. Hsieh / Deliverance</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the movement goes out of the sphere of danger. The obstacle has
    been removed, the difficulties are being resolved. Deliverance is not
yet    achieved; it is just in its beginning, and the hexagram represents
its various   stages.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  DELIVERANCE. The southwest furthers.<br>
         If there is no longer anything where one has to go,<br>
         Return brings good fortune.<br>
         If there is still something where one has to go,<br>
         Hastening brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to a time in which tensions and complications begin to
    be eased. At such times we ought to make our way back to ordinary conditions
    as soon as possible; this is the meaning of "the southwest." These periods
    of sudden change have great importance. Just as rain relieves atmospheric
    tension, making all the buds burst open, so a time of deliverance from
 burdensome   pressure has a liberating and stimulating effect on life. 
One  thing is important,  however: in such times we must not overdo our triumph.
 The point is not to  push on farther than is necessary. Returning to the
regular order of life  as soon as deliverance is achieved brings good fortune.
If there are any residual matters that ought to be attended to, it should
be done as quickly as possible, so that a clean sweep is made and no retardations
  occur.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder and rain set in:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of DELIVERANCE.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man pardons mistakes <br>
         And forgives misdeeds.</p>
                         
  <p>  A thunderstorm has the effect of clearing the air; the superior man
    produces a similar effect when dealing with mistakes and sins of men
that     induce a condition of tension. Through clarity he brings deliverance.
However,    when failings come to light, he does not dwell on them; he simply
passes   over mistakes, the unintentional transgressions, just as thunder
dies away.   He forgives misdeeds, the intentional transgressions, just as
water washes   everything clean.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  In keeping with the situation, few words are needed. The hindrance
    is past, deliverance has come. One recuperates in peace and keeps still.
   This is the right thing to do in times when difficulties have been overcome.<br>
          Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One kills three foxes in the field<br>
         And receives a yellow arrow.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The image is taken from the hunt. The hunter catches three cunning
    foxes and receives a yellow arrow as a reward. The obstacles in public
 life   are the designing foxes who try to influence the ruler through flattery.
   They must be removed before there can be any deliverance. But the struggle
   must not be carried on with the wrong weapons. The yellow color points
to   measure and mean in proceeding against the enemy; the arrow signifies
the   straight course. If one devotes himself wholeheartedly to the task
of deliverance,    he develops so much inner strength from his rectitude
that it acts as a  weapon  against all that is false and low.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If a man carries a burden on his back<br>
         And nonetheless rides in a carriage,<br>
         He thereby encourages robbers to draw near.<br>
         Perseverance leads to humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to a man who has come out of needy circumstances in to
    comfort and freedom from want. If now, in the manner of an upstart, he
 tries   to take his ease in comfortable surroundings that do not suit his
 nature,   he thereby attracts robbers. If he goes on thus he is sure to
bring  disgrace   upon himself. Confucius says about this line:</p>
                         
  <p>  Carrying a burden on the back is the business of common man; a carriage
    is the appurtenance of a man of rank. Now, when a common man uses the
appurtenance    of man of rank, robbers plot to take it away from him. If
a man is insolent    toward those above him and hard toward those below him,
robbers plot to  attack  him. Carelessness in guarding things tempts thieves
to steal. Sumptuous  ornaments  worn by a maiden are an enticement to rob
her of her virtue.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Deliver yourself from your great toe.</p>
                         
  <p>  Then the companion comes,<br>
         And him you can trust.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of standstill it will happen that inferior people attach
themselves to a superior man, and through force of daily habit they may grow
very close to him and become indispensable, just as the big toe is indispensable
to the foot because it makes walking easier. But when the time of deliverance
    draws near, with its call to deeds, a man must free himself from such
chance    acquaintances with whim he has no inner connection. For otherwise
the friends    who share his views, on whom he could really rely and together
 with whom   he could accomplish something, mistrust him and stay away.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If only the superior man can deliver himself,<br>
         It brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus he proves to inferior men that he is in earnest.</p>
                         
  <p>  Times of deliverance demand inner resolve. Inferior people cannot
be driven off by prohibitions or any external means. If one desires to be
rid of them, he must first break completely with them in his own mind; they
will see for themselves that he is in earnest and will withdraw.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall.<br>
         He kills it. Everything serves to further.</p>
                         
  <p>  The hawk on a high wall is the symbol of a powerful inferior in a
high position who is hindering the deliverance. He withstands the force of
inner influences, because he is hardened in his wickedness. He must be forcibly
    removed, and this requires appropriate means. Confucius says about this
  line:</p>
                         
  <p>  The hawk is the object of the hunt; bow and arrow are the tools and
    means. The marksman is man (who must make proper use of the means to
his    end). The superior man contains the means in his own person. He bides
his    time and then acts. Why then should not everything go well? He acts
and  is  free. Therefore all he has to do is to go forth, and he takes his
quarry.    This is how a man fares who acts after he has made ready the means.</p>
