<h1>䷗  Hexagram 24. Fu / Return (The Turning Point)</h1>
<title>䷗  Hexagram 24. Fu / Return (The Turning Point)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  The idea of a turning point arises from the fact that after the dark
    lines have pushed all of the light lines upward and out of the hexagram,
   another light line enters the hexagram from below. The time of darkness
 is  past. The winter solstice brings the victory of light. This hexagram
is linked  with the eleventh month, the month of the solstice (December-January).</p>
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  RETURN. Success.<br>
         Going out and coming in without error.<br>
         Friends come without blame.<br>
         To and fro goes the way.<br>
         On the seventh day comes return.<br>
         It furthers one to have somewhere to go.</p>
                         
  <p>  After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light
that has been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought
about by force. The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus
the movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation
of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced.
Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. Societies
of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come
together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish
separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN
is based on the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course
completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially.
Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning of
heaven and earth.   All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the
seventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of
the year begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so
too sunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven
is the number of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the
great darkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives
place to movement.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder within the earth:<br>
         The image of THE TURNING POINT.<br>
         Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes <br>
         At the time of solstice.<br>
         Merchants and strangers did not go about,<br>
         And the ruler<br>
         Did not travel through the provinces.</p>
                         
  <p>  The winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting
    time of the year--a custom that survives in the time of rest observed
at   the new year. In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the
Arousing,    is still underground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore
it must    be strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being
 used  prematurely.  This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing
 itself  to be reinforced  by rest, applies to all similar situations. The
 return of health after illness,  the return of understanding after an estrangement:
  everything must be treated  tenderly and with care at the beginning, so
that  the return may lead to a  flowering.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>   Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Return from a short distance.<br>
         No need for remorse.<br>
         Great good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Slight digressions from the good cannot be avoided, but one must turn
    back in time, before going too far. This is especially important in the
  development  of character; every faintly evil thought must be put aside
immediately,  before  it goes too far and takes root in the mind. Then there
is no cause  for remorse,  and all goes well.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Quiet return. Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Return always calls for a decision and is an act of self-mastery.
It is made easier if a man is in good company. If he can bring himself to
put aside pride and follow the example of good men, good fortune results.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Repeated return. Danger. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  There are people of a certain inner instability who feel a constant
    urge to reverse themselves. There is danger in continually deserting
the    good because of uncontrolled desires, then turning back to it again
because    of a better resolution. However, since this does not lead to habituation
  in evil, a general inclination to overcome the defect is not wholly excluded/</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Walking in the midst of others,<br>
         One returns alone.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man is in a society composed of inferior people, but is connected
    spiritually with a strong and good friend, and this makes him turn back
  alone.  Although nothing is said of reward and punishment, this return
is   certainly  favorable, for such a resolve to choose the good brings its
own   reward.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Noblehearted return. No remorse.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the time for return has come, a man should not take shelter in
    trivial excuses, but should look within and examine himself. And if he
 has   done something wrong he should make a noblehearted resolve to confess
 his   fault. No one will regret having taken this road.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Missing the return. Misfortune.<br>
         Misfortune from within and without.<br>
         If armies are set marching in this way,<br>
         One will in the end suffer a great defeat, <br>
         Disastrous for the ruler of the country.<br>
         For ten years<br>
         It will not be possible to attack again.</p>
                         
  <p>  If a man misses the right time for return, he meets with misfortune.
    The misfortune has its inner cause in a wrong attitude toward the world.
   The misfortune coming upon him for without results from this wrong attitude.
   What is pictured here is blind obstinacy and the judgment that is visited
   upon it.</p>
