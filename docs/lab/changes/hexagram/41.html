<h1>䷨  Hexagram 41. Sun / Decrease</h1>
<title>䷨  Hexagram 41. Sun / Decrease</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor
of the upper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to
the top, and the top line, originally weak, has replaced it. What is below
is decreased to the benefit of what is above. This is out-and-out decrease.
If the foundations of a building are decreased in strength and the upper
walls are strengthened, the whole structure loves its stability. Likewise,
a decrease in the prosperity of the people in favor of the government is
out-and-out decrease. And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to
showing how this shift of wealth can take place without causing the sources
of wealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth in the nation
and its lower classes to fail.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  DECREASE combined with sincerity<br>
         Brings about supreme good fortune<br>
         Without blame.<br>
         One may be persevering in this.<br>
         It furthers one to undertake something.<br>
         How is this to be carried out?<br>
         One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.</p>
                         
  <p>  Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase
    and decrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand
  the  time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a
time   of  scanty resources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel
ashamed   of simplicity. For simplicity is then the very thing needed to
provide inner    strength for further undertakings. Indeed, there need by
no concern if the   outward beauty of the civilization, even the elaboration
of religious forms,   should have to suffer because of simplicity. One must
draw on the strength   of the inner attitude to compensate for what is lacking
in externals; then   the power of the content makes up for the simplicity
of form.  There is no  need of presenting false appearances to God. Even
with slender means,  the  sentiment of the heart can be expressed.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  At the foot of the mountain, the lake:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of DECREASE.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man controls his anger<br>
         And restrains his instincts.</p>
                         
  <p>  The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases
    to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture. The
 mountain   stands as the symbol of stubborn strength that can harden into
 anger. The   lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into
 passionate drives  at the expense of the life forces. Therefore decrease
is necessary; anger  must be decreased by keeping still, the instincts must
be curbed by restriction.  By this decrease of the lower powers of the psyche,
 the higher aspects of  the soul are enriched/</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Going quickly when one's tasks are finished<br>
         Is without blame.<br>
         But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is unselfish and good when a man, after completing his own urgent
    tasks, uses his strength in the service of others, and without bragging
  or  making much of it, helps quickly where help is needed. But the man
in   a superior  position who is thus aided must weigh carefully how much
he can   accept without  doing the helpful servant or friend real harm. Only
where   such delicacy of  feeling exists can one give oneself unconditionally
and   without hesitation.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  To undertake something brings misfortune.<br>
         Without decreasing oneself,<br>
         One is able to bring increase to others.</p>
                         
  <p>  A high-minded self-awareness and a consistent seriousness with no
forfeit of dignity are necessary if a man wants to be of service to others.
He who throw himself away in order to do the bidding of a superior diminishes
his own position without thereby giving lasting benefit to the other. This
is wrong. To render true service of lasting value to another, one must serve
    him without relinquishing oneself.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  When three people journey together,</p>
                         
  <p>  Their number increases by one.<br>
         When one man journeys alone,<br>
          He finds a companion.</p>
                         
  <p>  When there are three people together, jealousy arises. One of them
    will have to go. Avery close bond is possible only between two people.
 But   when one man is lonely, he is certain to find a companion who complements
    him.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If a man deceases his faults,<br>
         It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man's faults often prevent even well-disposed people from coming
    closer to him. His faults are sometimes reinforced by the environment
in   which he lives. But if in humility he can bring himself to the point
of giving  them up, he frees his well-disposed friends from an inner pressure
 and causes  them to approach the more quickly, and there is mutual joy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Someone does indeed increase him.</p>
                         
  <p>  Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.</p>
                         
  <p>  Supreme good fortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  If someone is marked out by fate for good fortune, it comes without
    fail. All oracles-as for instance those that are read from the shells
of   tortoises-are bound to concur in giving him favorable signs. He need
fear   nothing, because his luck is ordained from on high.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If one is increased without depriving other,</p>
                         
  <p>  There is no blame.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         It furthers one to undertake something.<br>
         One obtains servants<br>
         But no longer has a separate home.</p>
                         
  <p>  There are people who dispense blessings to the whole world. Every
increase in power that comes to them benefits the whole of mankind and therefore
does not bring decrease to others. Through perseverance and zealous work
a man wins success and finds helpers as they are needed. But what he accomplishes
    is not a limited private advantage; it is a public good and available
to   everyone.</p>
