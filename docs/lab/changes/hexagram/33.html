<h1>䷠  Hexagram 33. TUN / Retreat</h1>
<title>䷠  Hexagram 33. TUN / Retreat</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
         below  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  The power of the dark is ascending. The light retreats to security,
    so that the dark cannot encroach upon it. This retreat is a matter not
 of   man's will but of natural law. Therefore in this case withdrawal is
proper;   it is the correct way to behave in order not to exhaust one's forces.
 In   the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July-August),
   in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  RETREAT. Success.<br>
         In what is small, perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are
    advancing. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to
be   confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances,
   whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss
the    right moment while we are in full possession of power and position.
Then   we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too
late   and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into
a desperate    life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not simple abandon the
field to the  opponent;  we make it difficult for him to advance by showing
perseverance  in single  acts of resistance. In this way we prepare, while
retreating, for the counter-movement.   Understanding the laws of a constructive
retreat of this sort is not easy.   The meaning that lies hidden in such
a time is important.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,</p>
                         
  <p>  Not angrily but with reserve.</p>
                         
  <p>  The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally
    comes to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into
   the distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of
the   superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts
   as the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is
a  form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object.
  The superior man shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior
man  to a standstill (mountain) by his dignified reserve.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous.<br>
         One must not wish to undertake anything.</p>
                         
  <p>  Since the hexagram is the picture of something that is retreating,
    the lowest line represents the tail and the top line the head. In a retreat
    it is advantageous to be at the front. Here one is at the back, in immediate
    contact with the pursuing enemy. This is dangerous, and under such circumstances
    it is not advisable to undertake anything. Keeping still is the easiest
  way  of escaping from the threatening danger.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  he holds him fast with yellow oxhide.</p>
                         
  <p>  No one can tear him loose.</p>
                         
  <p>  Yellow is the color of the middle. It indicates that which is correct
    and in line with duty. Oxhide is strong and not to be torn.  While the
 superior   men retreat and the inferior press after them, the inferior man
 represented   here holds on so firmly and tightly to the superior man that
 the latter cannot  shake him off. And because he is in quest of what is
right  an so strong in  purpose, he reaches his goal. Thus the line confirms
what  is said in the Judgment: "In what is small" --here equivalent to "in
the inferior man" -- "perseverance furthers."</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A halted retreat <br>
         Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.</p>
                         
  <p>  To retain people as men- and maidservants<br>
         Brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to
be held back, because then one no longer has freedom of action. In such a
case the only expedient is to take into one's service, so to speak, those
who refuse to let one go, so that one may at least keep one's initiative
and not fall helplessly under their domination. But even with this expedient
the situation is far from satisfactory--for what can one hope to accomplish
with such servants?</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man<br>
         And downfall to the inferior man.</p>
                         
  <p>  In retreating the superior man is intent on taking his departure willingly
    and in all friendliness. He easily adjusts his mind to retreat, because
  in  retreating he does not have to do violence to his convictions. The
only   one  who suffers is the inferior man from whom he retreats, who will
degenerate     when deprived of the guidance of the superior man.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is the business of the superior man to recognize in time that the
    moment for retreat has come. If the right moment is chosen, the retreat
  can  be carried out within the forms of perfect friendliness, without the
  necessity  of disagreeable discussions. Yet, for all the observance of
amenities,   absolute  firmness of decision is necessary if one is not to
be led astray   by irrelevant  considerations.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Cheerful retreat. Everything serves to further.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation is unequivocal. Inner detachment has become an established
    fact, and we are at liberty to depart. When one sees the way ahead thus
  clearly,  free of all doubt, a cheerful mood sets in, and one chooses what
  is right  without further thought. Such a clear path ahead always leads
to  the good.</p>
