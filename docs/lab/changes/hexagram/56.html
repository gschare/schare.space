<title>䷷  Hexagram 56. Lü / The Wanderer</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
         below  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  the mountain, Kên, stands still; above it fire, Li, flames up
    and does not tarry. Therefore the two trigrams do not stay together.
Strange     lands and separation are the wanderer's lot. When a man is a
wanderer and    stranger, he should not be gruff nor overbearing. He has
no large circle   of acquaintances, therefore he should not give himself
airs. He must be cautious   and reserved; in this way he protects himself
from evil. If he is obliging   toward others, he wins success.  A wanderer
has no fixed abode; his home  is the road. Therefore he must take care to
remain upright and steadfast,  so that he sojourns only in the proper places,
associating only with good  people. Then he has good fortune and can go his
way unmolested.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Fire on the mountain:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE WANDERER.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man<br>
         Is clear-minded and cautious<br>
         In imposing penalties,<br>
         And protracts no lawsuits.</p>
                         
  <p>  When grass on a mountain takes fire, there is bright light. However,
    the fire does not linger in one place, but travels on to new fuel. It
is   a phenomenon of short duration. This is what penalties and lawsuits
should   be like. They should be a quickly passing matter, and must not be
dragged   out indefinitely. Prisons ought to be places where people are lodged
only   temporarily, as guests are. They must not become dwelling places.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things, <br>
         He draws down misfortune upon himself.</p>
                         
  <p>  A wanderer should not demean himself or busy himself with inferior
    things he meets with along the way. The humbler and more defenseless
his    outward position, the more should he preserve his inner dignity. For
a stranger   is mistaken if he hopes to find a friendly reception through
lending himself    to jokes and buffoonery. The result will be only contempt
and insulting  treatment.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wanderer comes to an inn.<br>
         He has his property with him.<br>
         He wins the steadfastness of a young servant.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  The wanderer her described is modest and reserved. He does not lose
    touch with his inner being, hence he finds a resting place. In the outside
    world he does not lose the liking of other people, hence all persons
further     him, so that he can acquire property. Moreover, he wins the allegiance
 of   a faithful and trustworthy servant-a thing of inestimable value to
a  wanderer.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wanderer's inn burns down.<br>
         He loses the steadfastness of his young servant.<br>
         Danger.</p>
                         
  <p>  A truculent stranger does not know how to behave properly. He meddles
    in affairs and controversies that do not concern him; thus he loses his
  resting  place. He treats his servant with aloofness and arrogance; thus
 he loses the man's loyalty. When a stranger in a strange land has no one
left on whom he can rely, the situation becomes very dangerous.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wanderer rests in a shelter.<br>
         He obtains his property and an ax.<br>
         My heart is not glad.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a wanderer who knows how to limit his desires outwardly,
    though he is inwardly strong and aspiring. Therefore he finds at least
 a  place of shelter in which he can stay. He also succeeds in acquiring
property,    but even with this he is not secure. He must be always on guard,
ready to   defend himself with arms. Hence he is not at ease. He is persistently
conscious   of being a stranger in a strange land.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He shoots a pheasant.<br>
         It drops with the first arrow.<br>
         In the end this brings both praise and office.</p>
                         
  <p>  Traveling statesman were in the habit of introducing themselves to
    local princes with the gift of a pheasant, killing it at the first shot.
   Thus he finds friends who praise and recommend him, and in the end the
prince   accepts him and confers an office upon him.  Circumstances often
cause a  man to seek a home in foreign parts. If he knows how to meet the
situation  and how to introduce himself in the right way, he may find a circle
of friends   and a sphere of activity even in a strange country.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The bird's nest burns up.</p>
                         
  <p>  The wanderer laughs at first,</p>
                         
  <p>  Then must needs lament and weep.</p>
                         
  <p>  Through carelessness he loses his cow.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The picture of a bird whose nest burns up indicates loss of one's
resting place. This misfortune may overtake the bird if it is heedless and
imprudent when building its nest. It is the same with a wanderer. If he lets
himself go, laughing and jesting, and forgets that he is a wanderer, he will
later have cause to weep and lament. For if through carelessness a man loses
his cow-i.e., his modesty and adaptability-evil will result.</p>
