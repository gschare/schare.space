<title>䷐  Hexagram 17. Sui / Following</title>

<p id="alternative">

<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE<br>
         below  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  The trigram Tui, the Joyous, whose attribute is gladness, is above;
    Chên, the Arousing, which has the attribute of movement, is below.
   Joy in movement induces following. The Joyous is the youngest daughter,
 while   the Arousing is the eldest son. An older man defers to a young girl
 and shows  her consideration. By this he moves her to follow him.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  FOLLOWING has supreme success.<br>
         Perseverance furthers. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  In order to obtain a following one must first know how to adapt oneself.
    If a man would rule he must first learn to serve, for only in this way
 does   he secure from those below him the joyous assent that is necessary
 if they   are to follow him. If he has to obtain a following by force or
cunning, by  conspiracy or by creating faction, he invariably arouses resistance,
which  obstructs willing adherence. But even joyous movement can lead to
evil consequences,  hence the added stipulation, "Perseverance furthers"
--that is, consistency  in doing right-- together with "No blame." Just as
we should not ask others  to follow us unless this condition is fulfilled,
so it is only under this  condition that we can in turn follow others without
coming to harm.   The  thought of obtaining a following through adaptation
to the demands of the  time is a great and significant idea; this is why
the appended judgment is  so favorable.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder in the middle of the lake:<br>
         The image of FOLLOWING.<br>
         Thus the superior man at nightfall<br>
         Goes indoors for rest and recuperation.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and rests.
    Here it is the thunder in the middle of the lake that serves as the image--thunder
    in its winter rest, not thunder in motion. The idea of following in the
  sense  of adaptation to the demands of the time grows out of this image.
 Thunder  in the middle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest.
Similarly,  a superior man, after being tirelessly active all day, allows
himself rest  and recuperation at night. No situation can become favorable
until one is  able to adapt to it and does not wear himself out with mistaken
resistance.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The standard is changing.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         To go out of the door in company<br>
         Produces deeds.</p>
                         
  <p>  There are exceptional conditions in which the relation between leader
    and followers changes. It is implicit in the idea of following and adaptation
    that if one wants to lead others, one must remain accessible and responsive
    to the views of those under him. At the same time, however, he must have
   firm principles, so that he does not vacillate where there is only a question
   of current opinion. Once we are ready to listen to the opinions of others,
   we must not associate exclusively with people who share our views or with
   members of our own party; instead, we must go out and mingle freely with
  all sorts of people, friends or foes. That is the only way to achieve something.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If one clings to the little boy,<br>
         One loses the strong man.</p>
                         
  <p>  In friendships and close relationships an individual must make a careful
    choice. He surrounds himself either with good or with bad company; he
cannot    have both at once. If he throws himself away on unworthy friends
he loses    connection with people of intellectual power who could further
him in the    good.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If one clings to the strong man,<br>
         One loses the little boy.</p>
                         
  <p>  Through following one finds what one seeks.<br>
         It furthers one to remain persevering.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the right connection with distinguished people has been found,
    a certain loss naturally ensues. A man must part company with the inferior
    and superficial. But in his heart he will feel satisfied, because he
seeks     and needs for the development of his personality. The important
thing is   to remain firm. He must know what he wants and not be led astray
by momentary    inclinations.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Following creates success.<br>
         Perseverance brings misfortune.<br>
         To go one's way with sincerity brings clarity.<br>
         How could there be blame in this?</p>
                         
  <p>  It often happens, when a man exerts a certain amount of influence,
    that he obtains a following by condescension toward inferiors. But the
 people   who attach themselves to him are not honest in their intentions.
 They seek   personal advantage and try to make themselves indispensable
through  flattery   and subservience. If one becomes accustomed to such satellites
 and cannot   do without them, it brings misfortune. Only when a man is completely
 free   from his ego, and intent, by conviction, upon what is right and essential,
    does he acquire the clarity that enables him to see through such people,
   and become free of blame.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Sincere in the good. Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Every man must have something he follows--something that serves him
    as a lodestar. He who follows with conviction the beautiful and the good
   may feel himself strengthened by this saying.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He meets with firm allegiance<br>
         And is still further bound.<br>
         The king introduces him<br>
         To the Western Mountain.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to a man, an exalted sage, who has already put the turmoil
    of the world behind him. But a follower appears who understands him and
  is  not to be put off. So the sage comes back into the world and aids the
  other  in his work. Thus there develops an eternal tie between the two.
 The allegory  is chosen from the annals of the Chou dynasty. The rulers
of this dynasty  honored men who had served them well by awarding them a
place in the royal  family's temple of ancestors on the Western Mountain.
In this way they were  regarded as sharing in the destiny of the ruling family.
