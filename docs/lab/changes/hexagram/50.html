<h1>䷱  Hexagram 50. Ting / The Caldron</h1>
<title>䷱  Hexagram 50. Ting / The Caldron</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
         below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD</p>
                         
  <p>  The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom
    are the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears (handles), and
at   the  top the carrying rings. At the same time, the image suggests the
idea   of nourishment. The ting, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held
the cooked    viands in the temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The
heads of the  family  served the food from the ting into the bowls of the
guests.  <a href="48.html">THE WELL</a> likewise has the secondary meaning of giving
nourishment, but rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil
pertaining to a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing
of able men, which redounded to the benefit of the state.  This hexagram
and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that represent concrete,
men-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its abstract connotation.
 Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand
for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea
of preparing food.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE CALDRON. Supreme good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life, and this
    foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood,
  the  present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society.
Here  it  is the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit.
All  that  is visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the
invisible.    Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes
firm root    in the cosmic order.  Here we see civilization as it reaches
its culmination    in religion. The ting serves in offering sacrifice to
God. The highest earthly   values must be sacrificed to the divine. But the
truly divine does not manifest   itself apart from man. The supreme revelation
of God appears in prophets  and holy men. To venerate them is true veneration
of God. The will of God,  as revealed through them, should be accepted in
humility; this brings inner  enlightenment and true understanding of the
world, and this leads to great  good fortune and success.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Fire over wood:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE CALDRON.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man consolidates his fate <br>
         By making his position correct.</p>
                         
  <p>  The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood below,
the fire burns above. It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise
a fate that lends power to his life. And if he succeeds in assigning the
right place to life and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts
his fate on a firm footing. These words contain hints about fostering of
life as handed on by oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A ting with legs upturned.<br>
         Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.<br>
         One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  If a ting is turned upside down before being used, no harm is done-on
    the contrary, this clears it of refuse. A concubine's position is lowly,
   but because she has a son she comes to be honored.  These two metaphors
 express   the idea that in a highly developed civilization, such as that
indicated  by this hexagram, every person of good will can in some way or
other succeed.   No matter how lowly he may be, provided he is ready to purify
himself, he   is accepted. He attains a station in which he can prove himself
fruitful  in accomplishment, and as a result he gains recognition.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  There is food in the ting.<br>
         My comrades are envious,<br>
         But they cannot harm me.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  In a period of advanced culture, it is of the greatest importance
that one should achieve something significant. If a man concentrates on such
real undertakings, he may indeed experience envy and disfavor, but that is
not dangerous. The more he limits himself to his actual achievements, the
less harm the envious inflict on him.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The handle of the ting is altered.<br>
         One is impeded in his way of life.</p>
                         
  <p>  The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.<br>
         Once rain falls, remorse is spent.<br>
         Good fortune comes in the end.</p>
                         
  <p>  The handle is the means for lifting up the ting. If the handle is
altered, the ting cannot be lifted up and used, and, sad to say, the delicious
food in it, such as pheasant fat, cannot be eaten by anyone.  This describes
a man who, in a highly evolved civilization, finds himself in a place where
    no one notices or recognizes him. This is a severe block to his effectiveness.
    All of his good qualities and gifts of mind thus needlessly go to waste.
   But if he will only see to it that he is possessed of something truly
spiritual,     the time is bound to come, sooner or later, when the difficulties
will  be   resolved and all will go well. The fall of rain symbolizes here,
as in other   instances, release of tension.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The legs of the ting are broken.</p>
                         
  <p>  The prince's meal is spilled<br>
         And his person is soiled.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man has a difficult and responsible task to which he is not adequate.
    Moreover, he does not devote himself to it with all his strength but
goes     about with inferior people; therefore the execution of the work
fails.  In   this way he also incurs personal opprobrium.  Confucius says
about this   line:   "Weak character coupled with honored place, meager knowledge
with   large plans, limited powers with heavy responsibility, will seldom
escape   disaster."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The ting has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here we have, in a ruling position, a man who is approachable and
modest in nature. As a result of this attitude he succeeds in finding strong
and able helpers who complement and aid him in his work. Having achieved
this attitude, which requires constant self-abnegation, it is important for
him to hold to it and not to let himself be led astray.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p> Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The ting has rings of jade.<br>
         Great good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing that would not act to further.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the preceding line the carrying rings are described as golden,
to denote their strength; here they are said to be of jade. Jade is notable
for its combination of hardness with soft luster. This counsel, in relation
to the man who is open to it, works greatly t his advantage. Here the counsel
    is described in relation to the sage who imparts it. In imparting it,
he   will be mild and pure, like precious jade. Thus the work finds favor
in the  eyes of the Deity, who dispenses great good fortune, and becomes
pleasing   to men, wherefore all goes well. </p>
