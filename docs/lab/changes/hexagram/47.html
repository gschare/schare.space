<h1>䷮  Hexagram 47. K'un / Oppression (Exhaustion)</h1>
<title>䷮  Hexagram 47. K'un / Oppression (Exhaustion)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE<br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  The lake is above, water below; the lake is empty, dried up. Exhaustion
    is expressed in yet another way: at the top, a dark line is holding down
   two light line; below, a light line is hemmed in between two dark ones.
 The  upper trigram belongs to the principle of darkness, the lower to the
 principle  of light. Thus everywhere superior men are oppressed and held
in restraint  by inferior men.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  OPPRESSION. Success. Perseverance.</p>
                         
  <p>  The great man brings about good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.<br>
         When one has something to say,<br>
         It is not believed.</p>
                         
  <p>  Times of adversity are the reverse of times of success, but they can
    lead to success if they; befall the right man. When a strong man meets
 with   adversity, he remains cheerful despite all danger, and this cheerfulness
   is the source of later successes; it is that stability which is stronger
  than fate. He who lets his spirit be broken by exhaustion certainly has
no  success. But if adversity only bends a man, it creates in him a power
to react that is bound in time to manifest itself. No inferior man is capable
 of this. Only the great man brings about goof fortune and remains blameless.
 It is true that for the time being outward influence is denied him, because
 his words have no effect. Therefore in times of adversity it is important
 to be strong within and sparing of words.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  There is not water in the lake:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of EXHAUSTION.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man stakes his life<br>
         On following his will.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the water has flowed out below, the lake must dry up and become
    exhausted. That is fate. This symbolizes an adverse fate in human life.
  In  such times there is nothing a man can do but acquiesce in his fate
and   remain  true to himself. This concerns the deepest stratum of his being,
 for this  alone is superior to all external fate.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One sits oppressed under a bare tree<br>
         And strays into a gloomy valley.<br>
         For three years one sees nothing.</p>
                         
  <p>  When adversity befalls a man, it is important above all things for
    him to be strong and to overcome the trouble inwardly. If he is weak,
the    trouble overwhelms him. Instead of proceeding on his way, he remains
sitting    under a bare tree and falls ever more deeply into gloom and melancholy.
  This  makes the situation only more and more hopeless. Such an attitude
comes  from  an inner delusion that he must by all means overcome.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One is oppressed while at meat and drink.</p>
                         
  <p>  The man with the scarlet knee bands is just coming.<br>
         It furthers one to offer sacrifice.</p>
                         
  <p>  To set forth brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  This pictures a state of inner oppression. Externally, all is well,
    one has meat and drink. But one is exhausted by the commonplaces of life,
    and there seems to be no way of escape. Then help comes from a high place.
    A prince-in ancient China princes wore scarlet knee bands- is in search
  of  able helpers. But there are still obstructions to be overcome. Therefore
   it is important to meet these obstructions in the visible realm by offerings
    and prayer. To set forth without being prepared would be disastrous,
though     not morally wrong. Here a disagreeable situation must be overcome
by patience     of spirit.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone,<br>
         And leans on thorns and thistles.<br>
         He enters the house and does not see his wife.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This shows a man who is restless and indecisive in times of adversity.
    At first he wants to push ahead, then he encounters obstructions that,
 it   is true, mean oppression only when recklessly dealt with. He butts
his  head   against a wall and in consequence feels himself oppressed by
the wall.  Then   he leans on things that have in themselves no stability
and that are  merely   a hazard for him who leans on them.  Thereupon he
turns back irresolutely     and retires into his house, only to find, as
a fresh disappointment, that     his wife is not there. Confucius says about
this line: </p>
                         
  <p>  If a man permits himself to be oppressed by something that ought not
    to oppress him, his name will certainly be disgraced. If he leans on
things     upon which one cannot lean, his life will certainly be endangered.
For  him   who is in disgrace and danger, the hour of death draws near; how
can  he then  still see his wife?</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage.<br>
         Humiliation, but the end is reached.</p>
                         
  <p>  A well-to-do man sees the need of the lower classes and would like
    very much to be of help. But instead of proceeding with speed and energy
   where their is need, he begins in a hesitant and measured way. Then he
encounters    obstructions. Powerful and wealthy acquaintances draw him into
their circle;    he has to do as they do and cannot withdraw from them. Hence
he finds himself    in great embarrassment. But the trouble is transitory.
The original strength    of his nature offsets the mistake he has made, and
the goal is reached.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  His nose and feet are cut off.<br>
         Oppression at the hands of the man with the purple knee bands.<br>
         Joy comes softly.<br>
         It furthers one to make offerings and libations.</p>
                         
  <p>  An individual who has the good of mankind at heart is oppressed from
    above and below (this is the meaning of the cutting off of nose an defeat).
    He finds no help among the people whose duty it would be to aid in the
 work   of rescue (ministers wore purple knee bands). But little by little,
 things   take a turn for the better. Until that time, he should turn to
God,  firm  in his inner composure, and pray and offer sacrifice for the
general  well-being.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He is oppressed by creeping vines.<br>
         He moves uncertainly and says, "Movement brings remorse."<br>
         If one feels remorse over this and makes a start,<br>
         Good fortune comes.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man is oppressed by bonds that can easily be broken.  The distress
    is drawing to an end. But he is still irresolute; he is still influenced
   by the previous condition and fears that he may have cause for regret
if   he makes a move. But as soon as he grasps the situation, changes this
mental     attitude, and makes a firm decision, he masters the oppression.</p>
