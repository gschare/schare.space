<title>䷲  Hexagram 51. Chên / The Arousing (Shock, Thunder)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
         below  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  The hexagram Chên represents the eldest son, who seizes rule
    with energy and power. A yang line develops below two yin lines and presses
    upward forcibly. This movement is so violent that it arouses terror.
It   is  symbolized by thunder, which bursts forth from the earth and by
its shock    causes fear and trembling.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  SHOCK brings success.</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock comes-oh, oh!<br>
         Laughing words -ha, ha!</p>
                         
  <p>  The shock terrifies for a hundred miles,<br>
         And he does not let fall the sacrificial spoon and chalice.</p>
                         
  <p>  The shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the depths
    of the earth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is good, for joy
and    merriment can follow upon it.  When a man has learned within his heart
what   fear and trembling mean, he is safeguarded against any terror produced
by   outside influences. Let the thunder roll and spread terror a hundred
miles   around: he remains so composed and reverent in spirit that the sacrificial
   rite is not interrupted. This is the spirit that must animate leaders
and    rulers of men-a profound inner seriousness from which all terrors
glance   off harmlessly.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder repeated: the image of SHOCK.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus in fear and trembling</p>
                         
  <p>  The superior man sets his life in order<br>
         And examines himself.</p>
                         
  <p>  The shock of continuing thunder brings fear and trembling. The superior
    man is always filled with reverence at the manifestation of God; he sets
   his life in order and searches his heart, lest it harbor any secret opposition
    to the will of God. Thus reverence is the foundation of true culture.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>   Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock comes-oh, oh!</p>
                         
  <p>  Then follow laughing words-ha, ha!<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The fear and trembling engendered by shock come to an individual at
    first in such a way that he sees himself placed at a disadvantage as
against     others. But this is only transitory. When the ordeal is over,
he experiences     relief, and thus the very terror he had to endure at the
outset brings  good   fortune in the long run.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock comes bringing danger.<br>
         A hundred thousand times<br>
         You lose your treasures<br>
         And must climb the nine hills.<br>
         Do not go in pursuit of them.<br>
         After seven days you will get them back again.</p>
                         
  <p>  This pictures a situation in which a shock endangers a man and he
suffers great losses. Resistance would be contrary to the movement of the
time and for this reason unsuccessful. Therefore he must simply retreat to
heights inaccessible to the threatening forces of danger. He must accept
his loss of property without worrying too much about it. When the time of
shock and upheaval that has robbed him of his possessions has passed, he
will get them back again without going in pursuit of them.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock comes and makes one distraught.<br>
         If shock spurs to action<br>
         One remains free of misfortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  There are three kinds of shock-the shock of heaven, which is thunder,
    the shock of fate, and, finally, the shock of the heart. The present
hexagram     refers less to inner shock than to the shock of fate. In such
times of  shock,   presence of mind is all too easily lost: the individual
overlooks  all opportunities   for action and mutely lets fate take its course.
But if he allows the shocks   of fate to induce movement within his mind,
he will overcome these external   blows with little effort.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock is mired.</p>
                         
  <p>  Movement within the mind depends for its success partly on circumstances.
    If there is neither a resistance that might be vigorously combated, nor
  yet  a yielding that permits of victory-if, instead, everything is tough
 and inert  like mire-movement is crippled.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock goes hither and thither.<br>
         Danger.<br>
         However, nothing at all is lost.<br>
         Yet there are things to be done.</p>
                         
  <p>  This is a case not of a single shock but of repeated shocks with no
    breathing space between. Nonetheless, the shock causes no loss, because
  one  takes care to stay in the center of movement and in this way to be
spared    the fate of being helplessly tossed hither and thither.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around.<br>
         Going ahead brings misfortune.<br>
         If it has not yet touched one's own body<br>
         But has reached one's neighbor first,</p>
                         
  <p>  There is no blame.<br>
         One's comrades have something to talk about.</p>
                         
  <p>  When inner shock is at its height, it robs a man of reflection and
    clarity of vision. In such a state of shock it is of course impossible
 to   act with presence of mind. Then the right thing is to keep still until
 composure   and clarity are restored. But this a man can do only when he
himself is not  yet infected by the agitation, although its disastrous effects
are already   visible in those around him. If he withdraws from the affair
in time, he  remains free of mistakes and injury. But his comrades, who no
longer heed  any warning, will in their excitement certainly be displeased
with him. However,  he must not take this into account.</p>
