<h1>䷚  Hexagram 27. I / Corners of the Mouth (Providing Nourishment)</h1>
<title>䷚  Hexagram 27. I / Corners of the Mouth (Providing Nourishment)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth; above and below are firm
    lines of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth,
    through which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment
    itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented
   in the three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment
   and care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         Pay heed to the providing of nourishment<br>
         And to what a man seeks</p>
                         
  <p>  To fill his own mouth with.</p>
                         
  <p>  In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right
people should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment
in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to
observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates
    and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters
and    takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through
them.    Mencius says about this:</p>
                         
  <p>  If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only
    observe what part of his being he regards as especially important. The
 body   has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must
 not injure  important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we
injure the superior  parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates
the inferior  parts of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the
superior parts  of his nature is a superior man.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  At the foot of the mountain, thunder:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man is careful of his words<br>
         And temperate in eating and drinking.</p>
                         
  <p>  "God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring
the life forces stir again, all things comes into being anew. "He brings
to perfection in the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when
the seeds fall to earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing
nourishment through movement and tranquillity.  The superior man takes it
as a pattern for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words
are a movement going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements
from without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity.
For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding
proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding
its proper measure. Thus character is cultivated.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  You let your magic tortoise go,<br>
         And look at me with the corners of your mouth drooping.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The magic tortoise is a creature possessed of such supernatural powers
    that it lives on air and needs no earthly nourishment. The image means
 that   a man fitted by nature and position to live freely and independently
 renounces   this self-reliance and instead looks with envy and discontent
 at others who  are outwardly in better circumstances. But such base envy
only arouses derision  and contempt in those others. This has bad results.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Turning to the summit for nourishment,<br>
         Deviating from the path</p>
                         
  <p>  To seek nourishment from the hill.<br>
         Continuing to do this brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Normally a person either provides his own means of nourishment or
is supported in a proper way by those whose duty of privilege it is to provide
    for him. If, owing to weakness of spirit, a man cannot support himself,
  a  feeling of uneasiness comes over him; this is because in shirking the
 proper  way of obtaining a living, he accepts support as a favor from those
 in higher  place. This is unworthy, for he is deviating from his true nature.
 Kept up  indefinitely, this course leads to misfortune.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Turning away from nourishment.<br>
         Perseverance brings misfortune.<br>
         Do not act thus for ten years.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing serves to further.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  He who seeks nourishment that does not nourish reels from desire to
    gratification and in gratification craves desire. Mad pursuit of pleasure
    for the satisfaction of the senses never brings one to the goal. One
should     never (ten years is a complete cycle of time) follow this path,
for nothing     good can come of it.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Turning to the summit<br>
         For provision of nourishment<br>
         Brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Spying about with sharp eyes<br>
         Like a tiger with insatiable craving.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  In contrast to the six in the second place, which refers to a man
bent exclusively on his own advantage, this line refers to one occupying
a high position and striving to let his light sine forth. To do this he needs
helpers, because he cannot attain his lofty aim alone. With the greed of
a hungry tiger he is on the lookout for the right people. Since he is not
working for himself but for the good of all, there is no wrong in such zeal.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Turning away from the path.</p>
                         
  <p>  To remain persevering brings good fortune.<br>
         One should not cross the great water.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man may be conscious of a deficiency in himself. He should be undertaking
    the nourishment of the people, but he has not the strength to do it.
Thus     he must turn from his accustomed path and beg counsel and help from
a man    who is spiritually his superior but undistinguished outwardly. If
he maintains    this attitude of mind perseveringly, success and good fortune
are his. But   he must remain aware of his dependence. He must not put his
own person forward   nor attempt great labors, such as crossing the great
water.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p> Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The source of nourishment.<br>
         Awareness of danger brings good fortune.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a sage of the highest order, from whom emanate all
influences that provide nourishment for others. Such a position brings with
it heavy responsibility. If he remains conscious of this fact, he has good
fortune and may confidently undertake even great and difficult labors, such
as crossing the great water. These undertakings bring general happiness for
him and for all others.</p>
