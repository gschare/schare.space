<h1>䷾  Hexagram 63. Chi Chi / After Completion</h1>
<title>䷾  Hexagram 63. Chi Chi / After Completion</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
         below  LI THE  CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is the evolution of <a href="11.html">T'ai PEACE</a>.
  The transition from confusion to order is completed,
    and everything is in its proper place even in particulars. The strong
lines    are in the strong places, the weak lines in the weak places. This
is a very   favorable outlook, yet it gives reason for thought. For it is
just when perfect  equilibrium has been reached that any movement may cause
order to revert to disorder. The one strong line that has moved to the top,
thus effecting  complete order in details, is followed by the other lines.
Each moving according  to its nature, and thus suddenly there arises again
the hexagram <a href="12.html">P'i, STANDSTILL</a>.
  Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions
    of a time of climax, which necessitate the utmost caution.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  AFTER COMPLETION. Success in small matters.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.<br>
         At the beginning good fortune.<br>
         At the end disorder.</p>
                         
  <p>  The transition from the old to the new time is already accomplished.
    In principle, everything stands systematized, and it si only in regard
 to   details that success is still to be achieved. In respect to this, however,
    we must be careful to maintain the right attitude. Everything proceeds
 as   if of its own accord, and this can all too easily tempt us to relax
and let  thing take their course without troubling over details. Such indifference
    is the root of all evil. Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result.
 Here   we have the rule indicating the usual course of history. But this
rule is   not an inescapable law. He who understands it is in position to
avoid its   effects by dint of unremitting perseverance and caution.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Water over fire: the image of the condition <br>
         In AFTER COMPLETION.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man </p>
                         
  <p>  Takes thought of misfortune<br>
         And arms himself against it in advance.</p>
                         
  <p>  When water in a kettle hangs over fire, the two elements stand in
relation and thus generate energy (cf. the production of steam). But the
resulting tension demands caution. If the water boils over, the fire is extinguished
    an its energy is lost. If the heat is too great, the water evaporates
into    the air. These elements here brought in to relation and thus generating
  energy  are by nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution
  can prevent  damage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are
 in balance and  work in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best
 of order. In such times only the sage recognizes the moments that bode danger
  and knows how to banish it by means of timely precautions.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He breaks his wheels.<br>
         He gets his tail in the water.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times following a great transition, everything is pressing forward,
    striving in the direction of development and progress. But this pressing
   forward at the beginning is not good; it overshoots the mark and leads
with   certainty to loss and collapse. Therefore a man of strong character
does  not allow himself to be infected by the general intoxication but checks
his  course in time. He may indeed not remain altogether untouched by the
disastrous  consequences of the general pressure, but he is hit only from
behind like  a fox that, having crossed the water, at the last minute gets
its tail wet.  He will not suffer any real harm, because his behavior has
been correct.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The woman loses the curtain of her carriage.<br>
         Do not run after it;<br>
         On the seventh day you will get it.</p>
                         
  <p>  When a woman drove out in her carriage, she had a curtain that hid
    her from the glances of the curious. It was regarded as a breach of propriety
    to drive on if this curtain was lost.  Applied to public life, this means
    that a man who wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence
    of the authorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection.
    Especially in times "after completion" it may happen that those who have
   come to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves
   about fostering new talent.  This as a rule results in office seeking.
If   a man's superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and
means   of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned
against  such an unworthy procedure: "Do not seek it." Do not throw yourself
away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by
your own efforts. Times change. When the six stages of the hexagram have
passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man's own cannot be permanently
lost. It comes to him of its own accord. He need only be able to wait.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The Illustrious Ancestor<br>
         Disciplines the Devil's Country.<br>
         After three years he conquers it.<br>
         Inferior people must not be employed.</p>
                         
  <p>  "Illustrious Ancestor" is the dynastic title of the Emperor Wu Ting
    of the Yin dynasty. After putting his realm in order with a strong hand,
   he waged long colonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied
 the  northern borderland with constant threat of incursions.  The situation
 described  is as follows. After times of completion, when a new power has
 arisen and  everything within the country has been set in order, a period
 of colonial  expansion almost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out
 struggles  must be reckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy
 is especially  important. The territory won at such bitter cost must not
be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or another have hade
themselves impossible  at home, but who are thought to be quite good enough
for the colonies. Such  a policy ruins at the outset any chance of success.
This holds true in small  as well as large matters, because it is not only
rising states that carry  on a colonial policy; the urge to expand, with
its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious undertaking.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The finest clothes turn to rags.<br>
         Be careful all day long.</p>
                         
  <p>  In a time of flowering culture, an occasional convulsion is bound
to occur, uncovering a hidden evil within society and at first causing a
great sensation. But since the situation is favorable on the whole, such
evils can easily be glossed over and concealed from the public. Then everything
    is forgotten and peace apparently reigns complacently once more. However,
    to the thoughtful man, such occurrences are grave omens that he does
not    neglect. This is the only way of averting evil consequences.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox<br>
         Does not attain as much real happiness<br>
         As the neighbor in the west<br>
         With his small offering.</p>
                         
  <p>  Religious attitudes are likewise influenced by the spiritual atmosphere
    prevailing in times after completion. In divine worship the simple old
 forms   are replaced by an ever more elaborate ritual and an ever greater
 outward   display. But inner seriousness is lacking in this show of magnificence;
  human  caprice takes the place of conscientious obedience to the divine
will.  However,  while man sees what is before his eyes, God looks into the
heart.  Therefore  a simple sacrifice offered with real piety holds a greater
blessing  than an impressive service without warmth.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He gets his head in the water. Danger.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here in conclusion another warning is added. After crossing a stream,
    a man's head can get into the water only if he is so imprudent as to
turn     back. As long as he goes forward and does not look back, he escapes
this    danger. But there is a fascination in standing still and looking
back on   a peril overcome. However, such vain self-admiration brings misfortune.
It  leads only to danger, and unless one finally resolves to go forward without
  pausing, one falls a victim to this danger.</p>
