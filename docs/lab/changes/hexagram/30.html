<title>䷝  Hexagram 30. Li / The Clinging, Fire</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
         below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram Li means "to cling
    to something," and also "brightness." A dark line clings to two light
lines,    one above and one below--the image of an empty space between two
strong  lines,  whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram
represents  the middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central
line of the  Receptive,  and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire
has no definite  form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright.
As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While
K'an means the soul shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE CLINGING. Perseverance furthers.<br>
         It brings success.<br>
         Care of the cow brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness
    of the latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself
   something that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out.
Everything    that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings,
in order  that  it may continue to shine.  Thus the sun and moon cling to
heaven, and  grain,   grass, and trees cling to the earth. So too the twofold
clarity of the dedicated   man clings to what is right and thereby can shape
the world. Human life on  earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes
this limitation  and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent
  forces of the cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme
  docility. By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary
  dependence,   man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place
 in the world.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  That which is bright rises twice:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of FIRE.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,<br>
         Illumines the four quarters of the world.</p>
                         
  <p>  Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day.
    The two together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function
    of light with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature
    in the human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light
    to spread farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever
more    deeply. </p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The footprints run crisscross.<br>
         If one is seriously intent, no blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is early morning and work begins. The mind has been closed to the
    outside world in sleep; now its connections with the world begin again.
  The  traces of one's impressions run crisscross. Activity and haste prevail.
  It  is important then to preserve inner composure and not to allow oneself
  to  be swept along by the bustle of life. If one is serious and composed,
  he can acquire the clarity of mind needed for coming to terms with the
innumerable     impressions that pour in. It is precisely at the beginning
that serious   concentration  is important, because the beginning holds the
seed of all  that is to follow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Midday has come; the sun shines with a yellow light. Yellow is the
    color of measure and mean. Yellow light is therefore a symbol of the
highest     culture and art, whose consummate harmony consists in holding
to the mean.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  In the light of the setting sun,<br>
         Men either beat the pot and sing<br>
         Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the end of the day has come. The light of the setting sun calls
    to mind the fact that life is transitory and conditional. Caught in this
   external bondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well.
  The sense of the transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited revelry
  in order to enjoy life while it lasts, or else they yield to melancholy
and  spoil the precious time by lamenting the approach of old age. Both attitudes
  are wrong. To the superior man it makes no difference whether death comes
  early or late. He cultivates himself, awaits his allotted time, and in
this   way secures his fate.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Its coming is sudden;<br>
         It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.</p>
                         
  <p>  Clarity of mind has the same relation to life that fire has to wood.
    Fire clings to wood, but also consumes it. Clarity of mind is rooted
in   life  but can also consume it. Everything depends upon how the clarity
functions.     Here the image used is that of a meteor or a straw fire. A
man who is excitable    and restless may rise quickly to prominence but produces
no lasting effects.    Thus matters end badly when a man spends himself too
rapidly and consumes    himself like a meteor.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.<br>
         Good fortune. </p>
                         
  <p>  Here the zenith of life has been reached. Were there no warning, one
    would at this point consume oneself like a flame. Instead, understanding
   the vanity of all things, one may put aside both hope and fear, and sigh
  and lament: if one is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good fortune
  will come from this grief. For here we are dealing not with a passing mood,
  as in the nine in the third place, but with a real change of heart.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The king used him to march forth and chastise.</p>
                         
  <p>  Then it is best to kill the leaders<br>
         And take captive the followers. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is not the purpose of chastisement to impose punishment blindly
    but to create discipline. Evil must be cured at its roots. To eradicate
  evil  in political life, it is best to kill the ringleaders and spare the
  followers.  In educating oneself it is best to root out bad habits and
tolerate   those  that are harmless. For asceticism that is too strict, like
sentences   of undue  severity, fails in its purpose.</p>
