<title>䷥  Hexagram 38. K'uei / Opposition</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME<br>
         below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is composed of the trigram Li above, i.e., flame, which
    burns upward, and Tui below, i.e., the lake, which seeps downward. These
   two movements are indirect contrast. Furthermore, LI is the second daughter
   and Tui the youngest daughter, and although they live in the same house
 they  belong to different men; hence their wills are not the same but are
 divergently  directed.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  OPPOSITION. In small matters, good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  When people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot carry
out a great undertaking in common; their points of view diverge too widely.
In such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that
would only increase the existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself
to producing gradual effects in small matters. Here success can still be
expected, because the situation is such that the opposition does not preclude
all agreement.  In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when
it represents polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful
and important functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and
nature, man and woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and reproduction
of life. In the world of visible things, the principle of opposites makes
possible the differentiation by categories through which order is brought
into the world.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Above, fire; below. The lake.</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of OPPOSITION.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus amid all fellowship </p>
                         
  <p>  The superior man retains his individuality.</p>
                         
  <p>  The two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even when in contact
    retain their own natures. So the sutured man is never led into baseness
  or  vulgarity through intercourse or community of interests with persons
 of another  sort; regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve
his individuality.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Remorse disappears.<br>
         If you lose your horse, do not run after it;<br>
         It will come back of its own accord.<br>
         When you see evil people,<br>
         Guard yourself against mistakes.</p>
                         
  <p>  Even in times when oppositions prevail, mistakes can be avoided, so
    that remorse disappears. When opposition begins to manifest itself, a
man    must not try to bring about unity by force, for by so doing he would
only    achieve the contrary, just as a horse goes farther and farther away
if one   runs after it. It it is one's won horse, one can safely let it go;
it will   come back of its own accord. So too when someone who belongs with
us is momentarily  estranged because of a misunderstanding, he will return
of his own accord  if we leave matters to him. One the other hand, it is
well to be cautious  when evil men who do not belong with us force themselves
upon us, again as  the result of a misunderstanding. Here the important thing
is to avoid mistakes.  We must not try to shake off these evil men by force;
  this would give rise  to real hostility. We must simply endure them. They
  will eventually withdraw  of their own accord.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One meets his lord in a narrow street.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  As a result of misunderstandings, it has become impossible for people
    who by nature belong together to meet in the correct way. This being
so,    an accidental meeting under informal circumstances may serve the purpose,
   provided there is an inner affinity between them.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One sees the wagon dragged back,</p>
                         
  <p>  The oxen halted,<br>
         A man's hair and nose cut off.</p>
                         
  <p>  Not a good beginning, but a good end.</p>
                         
  <p>  Often it seems tot a man as though everything were conspiring against
    him. He sees himself checked and hindered in his progress, insulted and
  dishonored.  However, he must not let himself be misled; despite this opposition,
  he must  cleave to the man with whom he knows he belongs. Thus, notwithstanding
   the  bad beginning, the matter will end well.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Isolated through opposition,<br>
         One meets a like-minded man<br>
         With whom one can associate in good faith.<br>
         Despite the danger, no blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  If a man finds himself in a company of people from whom he is separated
    by an inner opposition, he becomes isolated. But if in such a situation
  a  man meets someone who fundamentally by the very law of his being, is
kin   to him, and whom he can trust completely, he overcomes all the dangers
of   isolation. His will achieves its aim, and he becomes free of faults.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  The companion bits his way through the wrappings.<br>
         If one goes to him,<br>
         How could it be a mistake?</p>
                         
  <p>  Coming upon a sincere man, one fails to recognize him at first because
    of the general estrangement. However, he bites his way through the wrappings
    that are causing the separation. When such a companion thus reveals himself
    in his true character, it is one's duty to go to meet him and to work
with    him.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Isolated through opposition,<br>
         One sees one's companion as a pig covered with dirt,<br>
         As a wagon full of devils.<br>
         First one draws a bow against him,</p>
                         
  <p>  Then one lays the bow aside.<br>
         He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time.<br>
         As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the isolation is due to misunderstanding; it is brought about
    not by outer circumstances but by inner conditions. A man misjudges his
  best  friends, taking them to be as unclean as a dirty pig in and as dangerous
   as a wagon full of devils. He adopts an attitude of defense. But in the
 end,   realizing his mistake, he lays aside the bow, perceiving that the
other is  approaching with the best intentions for the purpose of close union.
Thus  the tension is relieved. The union resolves the tension, just as falling
   rain relieves the sultriness preceding a thunderstorm. All goes well,
for    just when opposition reaches its climax it changes over to its antithesis.</p>
