<h1>䷻  Hexagram 60. Chieh / Limitation</h1>
<title>䷻  Hexagram 60. Chieh / Limitation</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
         below TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  A lake occupies a limited space. When more water comes into it, it
    overflows. Therefore limits must be set for the water. The image shows
 water   below and water above, with the firmament between them as a limit.
  The Chinese  word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide
a  bamboo stalk.  In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets
 fixed limits upon  expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means
 the fixed limits that  the superior man sets upon his actions-the limits
of loyalty and disinterestedness.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  LIMITATION. Success.<br>
         Galling limitation must not be persevered in.</p>
                         
  <p>  Limitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we live economically
    in normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves
  us  from humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation
  of  world conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter,
    day and night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In the same
 way,   economy, by setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve
 property   and prevent injury to the people.  But in limitation we must
observe  due  measure. If a man should seek to impose galling limitations
upon his  own nature, it would be injurious. And if he should go too far
in imposing  limitations  on others, they would rebel. Therefore it is necessary
to set  limits even  upon limitation.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Water over lake: the image of LIMITATION.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man<br>
         Creates number and measure,<br>
         And examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.</p>
                         
  <p>  A lake is something limited. Water is inexhaustible. A lake can contain
    only a definite amount of the infinite quantity of water; this is its
peculiarity.    In human life too the individual achieves significance through
discrimination    and the setting of limits. Therefore what concerns us here
is the problem    of clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so
to speak, the backbone   of morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited
to man; if they existed,   his life would only dissolve in the boundless.
To become strong, a man's  life needs the limitations ordained by duty and
voluntarily accepted. The  individual attains significance as a free spirit
only by surrounding himself  with these limitations and by determining for
himself what his duty is.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>

  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Not going out of the door and the courtyard<br>
         Is without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Often a man who would like to undertake something finds himself confronted
    by insurmountable limitations. Then he must know where to stop. If he
rightly    understands this and does not go beyond the limits set for him,
he accumulates    an energy that enables him, when the proper time comes,
to act with great    force. Discretion is of prime importance in preparing
the way for momentous    things. Concerning this, Confucius says:</p>
                         
  <p>  Where disorder develops, words are the first steps. If the prince
is not discreet, he loses his servant. If the servant is not discreet he
loses his life. If germinating things are not handled with discretion, the
perfecting of them is impeded. Therefore the superior man is careful to maintain
silence and does not go forth.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Not going out of the gate and the courtyard<br>
         Brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the time for action has come, the moment must be quickly seized.
    Just as water first collects in a lake without flowing out, yet is certain
    to find an outlet when the lake is full, so it is in the life of man.
It   is a good thing to hesitate so long as the time for action has not come,
  but no longer. Once the obstacles to action have been removed, anxious
hesitation     is a mistake that is bound to bring disaster, because one
misses one's  opportunity.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He who knows limitation<br>
         Will have cause to lament.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  If an individual is bent only on pleasures and enjoyment, it is easy
    for him to lose his sense of the limits that are necessary. If he gives
  himself  over to extravagance, he will have to suffer the consequences,
with  accompanying  regret. He must not seek to lay the blame on others.
Only when  we realize  that our mistakes are of our own making will such
disagreeable  experiences  free us of errors.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Contented limitation. Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  Every limitation has its value, but a limitation that requires persistent
    effort entails a cost of too much energy. When, however, the limitation
  is  a natural one (as for example, the limitation by which water flows
only   downhill),  it necessarily leads to success, for then it means a saving
of  energy. The  energy that otherwise would be consumed in a vain struggle
with  the object,  is applied wholly to the benefit of the matter in hand,
and success is assured.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Sweet limitation brings good fortune.<br>
         Going brings esteem.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  The limitation must be carried out in the right way if it is to be
    effective. If we seek to impose restrictions on others only, while evading
    them ourselves, these restrictions will always be resented and will provoke
    resistance. If, however, a man in a leading position applies the limitation
    first to himself, demanding little from those associated with him, and
 with   modest means manages to achieve something, good fortune is the result.
 Where   such an example occurs, it meets with emulation, so that whatever
 is undertaken   must succeed.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Galling limitation.<br>
         Perseverance brings misfortune.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  If one is too severe in setting up restrictions, people will not endure
    them. The more consistent such severity, the worse it is, for in the
long     run a reaction is unavoidable. In the same way, the tormented body
will   rebel  against excessive asceticism. On the other hand, although ruthless
  severity  is not to be applied persistently and systematically, there may
  be times when it si the only means of safeguarding against guilt and remorse.
  In such situations ruthlessness toward oneself is the only means of saving
  one's soul, which otherwise would succumb to irresolution and temptation.</p>
