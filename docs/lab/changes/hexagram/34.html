<h1>䷡  Hexagram 34. Ta Chuang / The Power of the Great</h1>
<title>䷡  Hexagram 34. Ta Chuang / The Power of the Great</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                         
  <p>  The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful. Four
    light lines have entered the hexagram from below and are about to ascend
   higher. The upper trigram is Chên, the Arousing; the lower is ch'ien,
   the Creative. Ch'ien is strong, Chên produces movement. The union
 of  movement and strength gives the meaning of THE POWER OF THE GREAT. The
 hexagram  is linked with the second month (March-April).</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE POWER OF THE GREAT. Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  The hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force
    and comes to power. But its strength has already passed beyond the median
    line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power
    and forget to ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent
  on  movement, we may not wait for the right time. Therefore the added statement
    that perseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does
not    degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental
   principles of right and of justice. When we understand this point--namely,
   that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united--we understand
the    true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder in heaven above:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE POWER OF THE GREAT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths</p>
                         
  <p>  That do not accord with established order.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thunder--electrical energy--mounts upward in the spring. The direction
    of this movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven. It
 is   therefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power.
However,     true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right.
Therefore    in times of great power the superior man avoids doing anything
that is not   in harmony with the established order.</p>
                         
  <section id="lines">
  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Power in the toes.<br>
         Continuing brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This is certainly true.</p>
                         
  <p>  The toes are in the lowest place and are ready to advance. So likewise
    great power in lowly station is inclined to effect advance by force.
This,     if carried further, would certainly lead to misfortune, and therefore
by   way of advice a warning is added.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The premise here is that the gates to success are beginning to open.
    Resistance gives way and we forge ahead. This is the point at which,
only     too easily, we become the prey of exuberant self-confidence. This
is why    the oracle says that perseverance (i.e., perseverance in inner
equilibrium,    without excessive use of power) brings good fortune.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The inferior man works through power.</p>
                         
  <p>  The superior man does not act thus.</p>
                         
  <p>  To continue is dangerous.<br>
         A goat butts against a hedge<br>
         And gets its horns entangled.</p>
                         
  <p>  Making a boast of power leads to entanglements, just as a goat entangles
    its horns when it butts against a hedge. Whereas an inferior man revels
  in  power when he comes into possession of it, the superior man never makes
  this  mistake. He is conscious at all times of the danger of pushing ahead
  regardless  of circumstances, and therefore renounces in good time the
empty   display of force.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p> Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  The hedge opens; there is no entanglement.<br>
         Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.</p>
                         
  <p>  If a man goes on quietly and perseveringly working at the removal
of resistances, success comes in the end. The obstructions give way and all
occasion for remorse arising from excessive use of power disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  Such a man's power does not show externally, yet it can move heavy
    loads, like a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle. The less
that    power is applied outwardly, the greater its effect.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Loses the goat with ease.</p>
                         
  <p>  No remorse.</p>
                         
  <p>  The goat is noted for hardness outwardly and weakness within. Now
the situation is such that everything is easy; there is no more resistance.
One can give up a belligerent, stubborn way of acting and will not have to
regret it.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A goat butts against a hedge.<br>
         It cannot go backward, it cannot go forward.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing serves to further.<br>
         If one notes the difficulty, this brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  If we venture too far we come to a deadlock, unable either to advance
    or to retreat and whatever we do merely serves to complicate thing further.
    Such obstinacy leads to insuperable difficulties. But if, realizing the
  situation,  we compose ourselves and decide not to continue, everything
will  right itself  in time.</p>
