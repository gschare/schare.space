         below TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram, like sun, is one of the eight formed by doubling of
    a trigram. The trigram Tui denotes the youngest daughter; it is symbolized
    by the smiling lake, and its attribute is joyousness. Contrary to appearances,
    it is not the yielding quality of the top line that accounts for joy
here.     The attribute of the yielding or dark principle is not joy but
melancholy.     However, joy is indicated by the fact that there are two
strong lines within,    expressing themselves through the medium of gentleness.
 True joy, therefore,    rests on firmness and strength within, manifesting
itself outwardly as yielding   and gentle.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE JOYOUS. Success.<br>
         Perseverance is favorable.</p>
                         
  <p>  The joyous mood is infectious and therefore brings success. But joy
    must be based on steadfastness if it is not to degenerate into uncontrolled
    mirth. Truth and strength must dwell in the heart, while gentleness reveals
    itself in social intercourse. In this way one assumes the right attitude
   toward God and man and achieves something. Under certain conditions, intimidation
    without gentleness may achieve something momentarily, but not for all
time.    When, on the other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness,
they   are led to take all hardships upon themselves willingly, and if need
be will  not shun death itself, so great is the power of joy over men.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Lakes resting one on the other:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE JOYOUS.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man joins with his friends<br>
         For discussion and practice.</p>
                         
  <p>  A lake evaporates upward and thus gradually dries up; but when two
    lakes are joined they do not dry up so readily, for one replenishes the
  other.  It is the same in the field of knowledge. Knowledge should be a
refreshing    and vitalizing force. It becomes so only through stimulating
intercourse   with congenial friends with whom one holds discussion and practices
application    of the truths of life. In this way learning becomes many-sided
and takes   on a cheerful lightness, whereas there is always something ponderous
and  one-sided about the learning of the self-taught.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Contented joyousness. Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A quiet, wordless, self-contained joy, desiring nothing from without
    and resting content with everything, remains free of all egotistic likes
   and dislikes. In this freedom lies good fortune, because it harbors the
 quiet   security of a heart fortified within itself.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Sincere joyousness. Good fortune.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  We often find ourselves associating with inferior people in whose
company we are tempted by pleasures that are inappropriate for the superior
man. To participate in such pleasures would certainly bring remorse, for
a superior man can find no real satisfaction in low pleasures. When, recognizing
this, a man does not permit his will to swerve, so that he does not find
such ways agreeable, not even dubious companions will venture to proffer
any base pleasures, because he would not enjoy them. Thus every cause for
regret is removed.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Coming joyousness. Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  True joy must spring from within. But if one is empty within and wholly
    given over to the world, idle pleasures come streaming in from without.
  This  is what many people welcome as diversion. Those who lack inner stability
   and therefore need amusement, will always find opportunity of indulgence.
   They attract external pleasures by the emptiness of their natures. Thus
 they  lose themselves more and more, which of course has bad results.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Joyousness that is weighed is not at peace.<br>
         After ridding himself of mistakes a man has joy.</p>
                         
  <p>  Often a man finds himself weighing the choice between various kinds
    of pleasures, and so long as he has not decided which kind he will choose,
    the higher or the lower, he has no inner peace. Only when he clearly
recognizes     that passion brings suffering, can he make up his mind to
turn away from    the lower pleasures and to strive for the higher. Once
this decision is  sealed,   he finds true joy and peace, and inner conflict
is overcome.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Sincerity toward disintegrating influences is dangerous.</p>
                         
  <p>  Dangerous elements approach even the far best of men. If a man permits
    himself to have anything to do with them, their disintegrating influence
   acts slowly but surely, and inevitable brings dangers in its train. But
 if  he recognizes the situation and can comprehend the danger, he knows
how  to  protect himself and remains unharmed.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Seductive joyousness.</p>
                         
  <p>  A vain nature invites diverting pleasures and must suffer accordingly
    (cf. the six in the third place). If a man is unstable within, the pleasures
    of the world that he does not shun have so powerful an influence that
he   is swept along by them. Here it is no longer a question of danger, of
good   fortune or misfortune. He has given up direction of his own life,
and what   becomes of him depends upon chance and external influences.</p>
