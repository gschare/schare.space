<title>䷩  Hexagram 42. I / Increase</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>

  <p>  above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND<br>
         below CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  The idea of increase is expressed in the fact that the strong lowest
    line of the upper trigram has sunk down and taken its place under the
lower    trigram. This conception also expresses the fundamental idea on
which the    Book of Changes is based. To rule truly is to serve.  A sacrifice
of the   higher element that produces an increase of the lower is called
an out-and-out   increase: it indicates the spirit that alone has power to
help the world.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  INCREASE. It furthers one</p>
                         
  <p>  To undertake something.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.</p>
                         
  <p>  Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below
    fills the people with a sense of joy and gratitude that is extremely
valuable     for the flowering of the commonwealth. When people are thus
devoted to  their   leaders, undertakings are possible, and even difficult
and dangerous  enterprises   will succeed. Therefore in such times of progress
and successful  development   it is necessary to work and make the best use
of time. This  time resembles   that of the marriage of heaven and earth,
when the earth  partakes of the  creative power of heaven, forming and bringing
forth living  beings. The time  of INCREASE does not endure, therefore it
must be utilized  while it lasts.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Wind and thunder: the image of INCREASE.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man:<br>
         If he sees good, he imitates it;<br>
         If he has faults, he rids himself of them.</p>
                         
  <p>  While observing how thunder and wind increase and strengthen each
other, a man can not the way to self-increase and self-improvement. When
he discovers good in others, he should imitate it and thus make everything
on earth his own. If he perceives something bad in himself, let him rid himself
of it. In this way he becomes free of evil. This ethical change represents
the most important increase of personality.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  It furthers one to accomplish great deeds.</p>
                         
  <p>  Supreme good fortune. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  If great help comes to a man from on high, this increased strength
    must be used to achieve something great for which he might otherwise
never     have found energy, or readiness to take responsibility. Great good
fortune     is produced by selflessness, and in bringing about great good
fortune,  he   remains free of reproach.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Someone does indeed increase him; </p>
                         
  <p>  Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.<br>
         Constant perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The king presents him before God.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man brings about real increase by producing in himself the conditions
    for it, that it, through receptivity to and love of the good. Thus the
 thing   for which he strives comes of itself, with the inevitability of
natural   law.  Where increase is thus in harmony with the highest laws of
the universe,    it cannot be prevented by any constellation of accidents.
But everything   depends on his not letting unexpected good fortune make
him heedless; he  must make it his own through inner strength an steadfastness.
Then he acquires   meaning before God and man, and can accomplish something
for the good of  the world.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One is enriched through unfortunate events.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame, if you are sincere<br>
         And walk in the middle,<br>
         And report with a seal to the prince.</p>
                         
  <p>  A time of blessing and enrichment has such powerful effects that even
    events ordinarily unfortunate must turn out to the advantage of those
affected    by them. These persons become free of error, and by acting in
harmony with    truth they gain such inner authority that they exert influence
as if sanctioned    by the letter and seal.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If you walk in the middle <br>
         And report the prince,<br>
         He will follow.<br>
         It furthers one to be used<br>
         In the removal of the capital.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is important that there should be men who mediate between leaders
    and followers. These should be disinterested people, especially in times
   of increase, since the benefit is to spread from the leader to the people.
   Nothing of this benefit should be held back in a selfish way; it should
 really  reach those for whom it is intended. This sort of intermediary,
who  also exercises a good influence on the leader, is especially important
in  times when it is a matter of great undertakings, decisive for the future
and requiring the inner assent of all concerned.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.</p>
                         
  <p>  Supreme good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue. </p>
                         
  <p>  True kindness does not count upon nor ask about merit and gratitude
    but acts from inner necessity. And such a truly kind heart finds itself
  rewarded  in being recognized, and thus the beneficent influence will spread
  unhindered.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He brings increase to no one.<br>
         Indeed, someone even strikes him.<br>
         He does not keep his heart constantly steady.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The meaning here is that through renunciation those in high place
should bring increase to those below. By neglecting this duty and helping
no one, they in turn lose the furhtering influence of others and soon find
themselves alone. In this way they invite attacks. An attitude not permanently
in harmony with the demands of the time will necessarily bring misfortune
with it. Confucius says about this line:</p>
                         
  <p>  The superior man sets his person at rest before he moves; he composes
    his mind before he speaks; he makes his relations firm before he asks
for    something. By attending to these three matters, the superior man gains
 complete   security. But if a man is brusque in his movements, others will
 not cooperate.   If he is agitated in his word, they awaken no echo in others.
 If he asks  for something without having fist established relations, it
will  not be given   to him. If no one is with him, those who would harm
him draw  near.</p>
