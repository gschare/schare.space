<h1>䷳  Hexagram 52. Kên / Keeping Still, Mountain</h1>
<title>䷳  Hexagram 52. Kên / Keeping Still, Mountain</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son of heaven
    and earth. The male principle is at the top because it strives upward
by   nature; the female principle is below, since the direction of its movement
   has come to its normal end.  In its application to man, the hexagram turns
   upon the problem of achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring
   quiet to the heart. While Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing
away    of all movement in nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is
merely    a state of polarity that always posits movement as its complement.
Possibly    the words of the text embody directions for the practice of yoga.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  KEEPING STILL. Keeping his back still</p>
                         
  <p>  So that he no longer feels his body.<br>
         He goes into his courtyard<br>
         And does not see his people.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still,
    and going forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest
   and movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there
   is light in life.  The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of
all   movement. The back is named because in the back are located all the
nerve   fibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves
is brought  to a standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as
it were. When  a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world.
 He no longer  sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and
 therefore he  has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding
 the great laws  of the universe and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever
 acts from these   deep levels makes no mistakes.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Mountains standing close together:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of KEEPING STILL.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man<br>
         Does not permit his thoughts </p>
                         
  <p>  To go beyond his situation.</p>
                         
  <p>  The heart thinks constantly. This cannot be changed, but the movements
    of the heart-that is, a man's thoughts-should restrict themselves to
the    immediate situation. All thinking that goes beyond this only makes
the heart   sore.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Keeping his toes still.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.<br>
         Continued perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Keeping the toes still means halting before one has even begun to
move. The beginning is the time of few mistakes. At that time one is still
in harmony with primal innocence. Not yet influenced by obscuring interests
and desires, one sees things intuitively as they really are. A man who halts
at the beginning, so long as he has not yet abandoned the truth, finds the
right way. But persisting firmness is needed to keep one from drifting irresolutely.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Keeping his calves still.<br>
         He cannot rescue him whom he follows.<br>
         His heart is not glad.</p>
                         
  <p>  The leg cannot move independently; it depends on the movement of the
    body. If a leg is suddenly stopped while the whole body is in vigorous
 motion,   the continuing body movement will make one fall.  The same is
true  of a man  who serves a master stronger than himself. He is swept along,
and  even though  he may himself halt on the path of wrongdoing, he can no
longer  check the  other in his powerful movement. Where the master presses
forward,  the servant,  no matter how good his intentions, cannot save him.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Keeping his hips still.<br>
         Making his sacrum stiff.<br>
         Dangerous. The heart suffocates.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to enforced quiet. The restless heart is to be subdued
    by forcible means. But fire when it is smothered changes into acrid smoke
    that suffocates as it spreads.  Therefore, in exercises in meditation
and    concentration, one ought not to try to force results. Rather, calmness
 must   develop naturally out of a state of inner composure. If one tries
to induce   calmness by means of artificial rigidity, meditation will lead
to very unwholesome   results.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Keeping his trunk still.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  As has been pointed out above in the comment on the Judgment, keeping
    the back at rest means forgetting the ego. This is the highest stage
of   rest.  Here this stage has not yet been reached: the individual in this
instance,    though able to keep the ego, with its thoughts and impulses,
in a state  of  rest, is not yet quite liberated from its dominance. Nonetheless,
keeping    the heart at rest is an important function, leading in the end
to the complete    elimination of egotistic drives. Even though at this point
one does not  yet  remain free from all the dangers of doubt and unrest,
this frame of mind is not a mistake, as it leads ultimately to that other,
higher level.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Keeping his jaws still.</p>
                         
  <p>  The words have order.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man in a dangerous situation, especially when he is not adequate
    to it, is inclined to be very free with talk and presumptuous jokes.
But    injudicious speech easily leads to situations that subsequently give
much    cause for regret. However, if a man is reserved in speech, his words
take    ever more definite form, and every occasion for regret vanishes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p> Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Noblehearted keeping still.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This marks the consummation of the effort to attain tranquillity.
One is at rest, not merely in a small, circumscribed way in regard to matters
    of detail, but one has also a general resignation in regard to life as
 a  whole, and this confers peace and good fortune in relation to every individual
   matter.</p>
