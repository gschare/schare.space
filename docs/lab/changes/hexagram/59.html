<h1>䷺  Hexagram 59. Huan / Dispersion [Dissolution]</h1>
<title>䷺  Hexagram 59. Huan / Dispersion [Dissolution]</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND<br>
         below K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  Wind blowing over water disperses it, dissolving it into foam and
mist. This suggests that when a man's vital energy is dammed up within him
(indicated as a danger by the attribute of the lower trigram), gentleness
serves to break up and dissolve the blockage.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  DISPERSION. Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The king approaches his temple.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  The text of this hexagram resembles that of <a href="45.html">Ts'ui, GATHERING TOGETHER</a>. In the latter, the subject is the bringing together
    of elements that have been separated, as water collects in lakes upon
the    earth. Here the subject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive
egotism.    DISPERSION shows the way, so to speak, that leads to gathering
together.   This explains the similarity of the two texts.  Religious forces
are needed   to overcome the egotism that divides men. The common celebration
of the great   sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which gave expression
simultaneously    to the interrelation and social articulation of the family
and state, was    the means of employed by the great ruler to unite men.
The sacred music  and  the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong tide
of emotion that  was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened a
consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity
was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is co-operation
in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the will of the people;
 in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as,
 when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must unite in a joint
task.   But only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations,
 and who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving
 the hardness of egotism.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  The wind drives over the water:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of DISPERSION.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord<br>
         And built temples.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the autumn and winter, water begins to freeze into ice. When the
    warm breezes of spring come, the rigidity is dissolved, and the elements
   that have been dispersed in ice floes are reunited. It is the same with
 the  minds of the people. Through hardness and selfishness the heart grows
 rigid,  and this rigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and
 cupidity  isolate men. Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout
 emotion.  They must be shaken by a religious awe in face of eternity-stirred
 with an  intuition of the One Creator of all living beings, and united through
  the  strong feeling of fellowship experienced in the ritual of divine worship.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He brings help with the strength of a horse.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is important that disunion should be overcome at the outset, before
    it has become complete-that the clouds should be dispersed before they
 have   brought storm and rain. At such times when hidden divergences in
temper   make  themselves felt and lead to mutual misunderstandings we must
take quick  and  vigorous action to dissolve the misunderstandings and mutual
distrust.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  At the dissolution<br>
         He hurries to that which supports him.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  When an individual discovers within himself the beginnings of alienation
    from others, of misanthropy and ill humor, he must set about dissolving
  these  obstructions. He must rouse himself inwardly, hasten to that which
  supports  him. Such support is never found in hatred, but always in a moderate
  and just judgment of men, linked with good will. If he regains this unobstructed
   outlook on humanity, while at the same time all saturnine ill humor is
dissolved,    all occasion for remorse disappears.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He dissolves his self. No remorse.</p>
                         
  <p>  Under certain circumstances, a man's work may become so difficult
that he can no longer think of himself. He must set aside all personal desires
    and disperse whatever the self gathers about it to serve as a barrier
against    others. Only on the basis of great renunciation can he obtain
the strength    for great achievements. By setting his goal in a great task
outside himself,    he can attain this standpoint.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He dissolves his bond with his group.</p>
                         
  <p>  Supreme good fortune.<br>
         Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.</p>
                         
  <p>  This is something that ordinary men do not think of.</p>
                         
  <p>  When we are working at a task that affects the general welfare, we
    must leave all private friendships out of account. Only by rising above
  party  interests can we achieve something decisive. He who has the courage
  thus to forego what is near wins what is afar. But in order to comprehend
  this standpoint, one must have a wide view of the interrelationships of
life,  such as only unusual men attain.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.<br>
         Dissolution! A king abides without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of general dispersion and separation, a great idea provides
    a focal point for the organization of recovery. Just as an illness reaches
    its crisis in a dissolving sweat, so a great stimulating idea is a true
  salvation  in times of general deadlock. It gives the people a rallying
point-a  man in a ruling position who can dispel misunderstandings.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He dissolves his blood.<br>
         Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,<br>
         Is without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  The idea of the dissolving of a man's blood means the dispersion of
    that which might lead to bloodshed and wounds, i.e., avoidance of danger.
    But here the thought is not that a man avoids difficulties for himself
 alone,   but rather that he rescues his kin-helps them to get away before
 danger comes,  or to keep at a distance from an existing danger, or to find
 a way out of  a danger that is already upon them. In this way he does what
 is right.</p>
