<h1>䷃  Hexagram 4. Mêng / Youthful Folly</h1>
<title>䷃  Hexagram 4. Mêng / Youthful Folly</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN <br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different
    ways. The image of the upper trigram, Kên, is the mountain, that
 of   the lower, K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain
   is the image of inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of
the   upper trigram; that of the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in
perplexity   on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of
youth. However,    the two trigrams also show the way of overcoming the follies
of youth. Water   is something that of necessity flows on. When the spring
gushes forth, it   does not know at first where it will go. But its steady
flow fills up the   deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.<br>
         It is not I who seek the young fool;<br>
         The young fool seeks me.<br>
         At the first oracle I inform him. <br>
         If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.<br>
         If he importunes, I give him no information.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite
    of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude
    toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be
conscious     of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without
this modesty    and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary
receptivity,    which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the
teacher. This    is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out
instead of offering    himself. Only thus can the instruction take place
at the right time and  in  the right way.  A teacher's answer to the question
of a pupil ought to  be  clear and definite like that expected from an oracle;
thereupon it ought   to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and
a basis for decision.   If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept
up, it serves only to   annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence,
just as the oracle   gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions
 implying doubt.    Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until
 the points are mastered   one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus
 the hexagram counsels the   teacher as well as the pupil.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:<br>
         The image of YOUTH.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man fosters his character<br>
         By thoroughness in all that he does.</p>
                         
  <p>  A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling
up all the hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed
    by thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily
    fills up all gaps and so flows onward.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  To make a fool develop<br>
         It furthers one to apply discipline.<br>
         The fetters should be removed.<br>
         To go on in this way bring humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  Law is the beginning of education. Youth in its inexperience is inclined
    at first to take everything carelessly and playfully.  It must be shown
  the  seriousness of life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand,
brought     about by strict discipline, is a good thing. He who plays with
life never     amounts to anything. However, discipline should not degenerate
into drill.     Continuous drill has a humiliating effect and cripples a
man's powers.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>   Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune.<br>
         To know how to take women<br>
         Brings good fortune.<br>
         The son is capable of taking charge of the household.</p>
                         
  <p>  These lines picture a man who has no external power, but who has enough
    strength of mind to bear his burden of responsibility. He has the inner
  superiority  and that enable him to tolerate with kindliness the shortcomings
  of human  folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker sex.
One   must understand  them and give them recognition in a spirit of chivalrous
  consideration. Only  this combination of inner strength with outer reserve
  enables one to take  on the responsibility of directing a larger social
body  with real success.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Take not a maiden who. When she sees a man of bronze,<br>
         Loses possession of herself.<br>
         Nothing furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  A weak, inexperienced man, struggling to rise, easily loses his own
    individuality when he slavishly imitates a strong personality of higher
  station.  He is like a girl throwing herself away when she meets a strong
  man. Such  a servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad
  both for the  youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her dignity to wait
  until she is  wooed. In both cases it is undignified to offer oneself,
and   no good comes  of accepting such an offer.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Entangled folly bring humiliation.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  For youthful folly it is the most hopeless thing to entangle itself
    in empty imaginings. The more obstinately it clings to such unreal fantasies,
    the more certainly will humiliation overtake it. Often the teacher, when
   confronted with such entangled folly, has no other course but to leave
the   fool to himself for a time, not sparing him the humiliation that results.
   This is frequently the only means of rescue.<br>
          Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Childlike folly brings good fortune. </p>
                         
  <p>  An inexperienced person who seeks instruction in a childlike and unassuming
    way is on the right path, for the man devoid of arrogance who subordinated
    himself to his teacher will certainly be helped.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  In punishing folly<br>
         It does not further one<br>
         To commit transgressions.<br>
         The only thing that furthers <br>
         Is to prevent transgressions.</p>
                         
  <p>  Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished. He who will not heed
    will be made to feel. This punishment is quite different from a preliminary
    shaking up. But the penalty should not be imposed in anger; it must be
 restricted   to an objective guarding against unjustified excesses. Punishment
 is never   an end in itself but serves merely to restore order.  This applies
 not only   in regard to education but also in regard to the measures taken
 by a government   against a populace guilty of transgressions. Governmental
 interference should   always be merely preventive and should have as its
sole aim the establishment   of public security and peace. </p>
