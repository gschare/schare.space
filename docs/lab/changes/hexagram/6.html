<h1>䷅  Hexagram 6. Sung / Conflict</h1>
<title>䷅  Hexagram 6. Sung / Conflict</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement;
the lower trigram, water, in accordance with its nature tends downward. Thus
the two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict.
     The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger,
    guile. Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict.  A third
indication    of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the combination
of deep   cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A person of this
 character   will certainly be quarrelsome.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  CONFLICT. You are sincere<br>
         And are being obstructed.<br>
         A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br>
         Going through to the end brings misfortune.<br>
         It furthers one to see the great man.<br>
         It does not further one to cross the great water.</p>
                         
  <p>  Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs
    into opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition
    leads to craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.
     If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being
 so   clear-headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to
terms   by meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the
bitter  end has evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity
is then  perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial
  man whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably
or   assure a just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water
is to  be avoided, that is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because
in  order to be successful they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict
within  weakens the power to conquer danger without.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Heaven and water go their opposite ways:<br>
         The image of CONFLICT.<br>
         Thus in all his transactions the superior man<br>
         Carefully considers the beginning.</p>
                         
  <p>  The image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the
opposing tendencies of the two trig rams. Once these opposing tendencies
appear, conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be
taken carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties
are exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals
harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>

  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If one does not perpetuate the affair,<br>
         There is a little gossip.<br>
         In the end, good fortune comes.</p>
                         
  <p>  While a conflict is in the incipient stage, the best thing To do is
    to drop the issue. Especially when the adversary is stronger, it is not
  advisable  to risk pushing the conflict to a decision. It may come to a
slight  dispute,  but in the end all goes well.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One cannot engage in conflict;<br>
         One returns home, gives way.<br>
         The people of his town,<br>
         Three hundred households, <br>
         Remain free of guilt.</p>
                         
  <p>  In a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace.
    Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. If, out of a false sense
of   honor, a man allowed himself to be tempted into an unequal conflict,
he would  be drawing down disaster upon himself. In such a case a wise and
conciliatory    attitude benefits the whole community, which will then not
be drawn into   the conflict.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.<br>
         Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.<br>
         If by chance you are in the service of a king,<br>
         Seek not works.</p>
                         
  <p>  This is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition.
    Only that which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanent
    possession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but
 since   it is really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man
 possesses   through the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one
 enters the  service of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking
 works for  the sake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the
 honor go to the other.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One cannot engage in conflict.<br>
         One turns back and submits to fate,<br>
         Changes one's attitude, <br>
         And finds peace in perseverance.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to a person whose inner attitude at first lacks peace.
    He does not feel content with his situation and would like to improve
it   through conflict. In contrast tot the situation of the nine in the second
   place, he is dealing with a weaker opponent and might therefore succeed.
  But he cannot carry on the fight, because, since right is not on his side,
  he cannot justify the conflict to his conscience. Therefore he turns back
  and accepts his fate. He changes his mind and finds lasting peace in being
  at one with eternal law. This brings good fortune.<br>
          Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  To contend before him<br>
         Brings supreme good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to an arbiter in a conflict who is powerful and just,
and strong enough to lend weight to the right side. A dispute can be turned
over to him with confidence. If one is in the right, one attains great good
fortune.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,'<br>
         By the end of a morning<br>
         It will have been snatched away three times.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here we have someone who has carried a conflict to the bitter end
and has triumphed. He is granted a decoration, but his happiness does not
last.  He is attacked again and again, and the result is conflict without
end.</p>
