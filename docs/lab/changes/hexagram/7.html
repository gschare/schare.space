<h1>䷆  Hexagram 7. Shih / The Army</h1>
<title>䷆  Hexagram 7. Shih / The Army</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K'an, water, and K'un, earth,
    and thus it symbolizes the ground water stored up in the earth. In the
 same   way military strength is stored up in the mass of the people--invisible
  in  times of peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes
    of the two trig rams are danger inside and obedience must prevail outside.
     Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong
    nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are
subordinate.    This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the
middle of one  of  the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather
than the upper trigram,  it represents not the ruler but the efficient general,
who maintains obedience  in the army by his authority.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE ARMY. The army needs perseverance<br>
         And a strong man.<br>
         Good fortune without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting
    force.<br>
         Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this
discipline     must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who
captures the    hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order
that he may  develop  his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his
ruler, who  must entrust   him with full responsibility as long as the war
lasts. But  war is always  a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction
and devastation.  Therefore   it should not be resorted to rashly but, like
a poisonous drug,  should be   used as a last recourse.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  In the middle of the earth is water:<br>
         The image of THE ARMY.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man increases his masses<br>
         By generosity toward the people.</p>
                         
  <p>  Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way
    the military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When
  danger  threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
  threatens,  every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes
back  to his plow.  He who is generous toward the people wins their love,
and a  people living  under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only
a people  economically  strong can be important in military power. Such power
must therefore be cultivated  by improving the economic condition of the
people and by humane government.  Only when there is this invisible bond
between government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
government as ground water is sheltered  by the earth, is it possible to
wage a victorious war.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  An army must set forth in proper order.<br>
         If the order is not good, misfortune threatens.</p>
                         
  <p>  At the beginning of a military enterprise, order is imperative. A
just and valid cause must exist, and the obedience and coordination of the
troops must be well organized, otherwise the result is inevitably failure.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>   Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  In the midst of the army.<br>
         Good fortune. No blame.<br>
         The king bestows a triple decoration.</p>
                         
  <p>  The leader should be in the midst of his army, in touch with it, sharing
    good and bad with the masses he leads. This alone makes him equal to
the    heavy demands made upon him. He needs also the recognition of the
ruler.   The decorations he receives are justified, because there is no question
of  personal preferment here: the whole army, whose center he is, is honored
 in his person.   </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because
    someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the
other    is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries
corpses  in  the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices
 to the  dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice
   was  made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead
 man's  place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this
custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting
in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by
the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty
clears up if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying. The
character fan, meaning "all," may have been misread as shih, which means
"corpse." Allowing for this error, the meaning would be that if the multitude
assumes leadership of the army (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The army retreats. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the face of a superior enemy, with whom it would be hopeless to
    engage in battle, an orderly retreat is the only correct procedure, because
    it will save the army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means
  a  sign of courage or strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle
    regardless of circumstances.
  </p></div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  There is game in the field.<br>
         It furthers one to catch it.<br>
         Without blame.<br>
         Let the eldest lead the army.<br>
         The younger transports corpses;<br>
         Then perseverance brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Game is in the field--it has left its usual haunts in the forest and
    is devastating the fields. This points to an enemy invasion. Energetic
 combat   and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not
degenerate   into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite
the greatest   degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune.
The army   must be directed by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging
  war,  not of permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands;
  if they do, defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there
  is danger of misfortune.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The great prince issues commands,<br>
         Founds states, vests families with fiefs.<br>
         Inferior people should not be employed.</p>
                         
  <p>  The war has ended successfully, victory is won, and the king divided
    estates and fiefs among his faithful vassals. But it is important that
 inferior   people should not come into power. If they have helped, let them
 be paid  off with money, but they should not be awarded lands or the privileges
 of  rulers, lest power be abused.</p>
