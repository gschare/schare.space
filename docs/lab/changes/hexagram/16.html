<h1>䷏  Hexagram 16. Yü / Enthusiasm</h1>
<title>䷏  Hexagram 16. Yü / Enthusiasm</title>

<p id="alternative">
</p>

<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
         below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                         
  <p>  The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading official,
    meets with response and obedience from all the other lines, which are
all    weak. The attribute of the upper trigram, Chên, is movement;
the attributes   of K'un, the lower, are obedience and devotion. This begins
a movement that   meets with devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm,
carrying all with  it. Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement
along the line  of least resistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated
as the law for natural events and for human life.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  ENTHUSIASM. It furthers one to install helpers<br>
         And to set armies marching.</p>
                         
  <p>   The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand
    an eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts
   in accord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To
arouse     enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his
ordinances     to the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability
of natural     laws rests on this principle of movement along the line of
least resistance.     Theses laws are not forces external to things but represent
the harmony   of  movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies
do not deviate     from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with
fixed regularity.     It is the same with human society: only such laws are
rooted in popular   sentiment  can be enforced, while laws violating this
sentiment merely arouse   resentment.   Again, it is enthusiasm that enables
us to install helpers  for the completion  of an undertaking without fear
of secret opposition. It is enthusiasm too  that can unify mass movements,
as in war, so that they  achieve victory.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:<br>
         The image of ENTHUSIASM.<br>
         Thus the ancient kings made music <br>
         In order to honor merit,<br>
         And offered it with splendor<br>
         To the Supreme Deity,<br>
         Inviting their ancestors to be present.</p>
                         
  <p>  When, at the beginning of summer, thunder--electrical energy--comes
    rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes
   nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make
themselves    felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart
and to loosen    the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart
expresses itself    involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic
movement of the  body.  From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the
invisible sound that moves  all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified
mankind.  Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated
and regulated  it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed
to purify  the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of
heroes and  thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the
temple men drew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later
the theater developed). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was
united with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the
ancestors. The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests
of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions.
This uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious
inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered
the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven,
in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact.  These
ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture. Confucius has said of the
great sacrifice at which these rites were performed: "He who could wholly
comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were spinning
on his hand."</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>

  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Enthusiasm that expresses itself<br>
         Brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man in an inferior position has aristocratic connections about which
    he boasts enthusiastically. This arrogance inevitably invites misfortune.<br>
         Enthusiasm should never be an egotistic emotion; it is justified 
only   when  it is a general feeling that unites one with others.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Firm as a rock. Not a whole day.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a person who does not allow himself to be misled by
    any illusions. While others are letting themselves be dazzled by enthusiasm,
    he recognizes with perfect clarity the first signs of the time. Thus
he   neither  flatters those above nor neglects those beneath him; he is
as firm   as a rock.  When the first sign of discord appears, he knows the
right moment   for withdrawing  and does not delay even for a day. Perseverance
in such  conduct will bring  good fortune. Confucius says about this line:</p>
                         
  <p>  To know the seeds, that is divine indeed. In his association with
those above him, the superior man does not flatter. In his association with
those beneath him, he is not arrogant. For he knows the seeds. The seeds
are the first imperceptible beginning of movement, the first trace of good
fortune (or misfortune) that shows itself. The superior man perceives the
seeds and immediately takes actin. He does not wait even a whole day. In
the Book of Changes it is said: "Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance
brings good fortune."</p>
                         
  <p>  Firm as a rock, what need of a whole day?</p>
                         
  <p>.  The judgment can be known.</p>
                         
  <p>.  The superior man knows what is hidden and what is evident.<br>
         He knows weakness, he knows strength as well.<br>
         Hence the myriads look up to him.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Enthusiasm that looks upward creates remorse.<br>
         Hesitation brings remorse.</p>
                         
  <p>  This line is the opposite of the preceding one: the latter bespeaks
    self-reliance, while here there is enthusiastic looking up to a leader.
  If  a man hesitates too long, this also will bring remorse. The right moment
   for approach must be seized: only then will he do the right thing.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The source of enthusiasm.<br>
         He achieves great things.<br>
         Doubt not.<br>
         You gather friends around you<br>
         As a hair clasp gathers the hair.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a man who is able to awaken enthusiasm through his
own sureness and freedom from hesitation. He attracts people because he has
no doubts and is wholly sincere. Owing to his confidence in them he wins
their enthusiastic co-operation and attains success. Just as a clasp draws
the hair together and hold it, so he draws man together by the support he
gives them.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Persistently ill, and still does not die.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here enthusiasm is obstructed. A man is under constant pressure, which
    prevents him from breathing freely. However, this pressure has its advantage--it
    prevents him from consuming his powers in empty enthusiasm. Thus constant
    pressure can actually serve to keep one alive.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:<br>
         Deluded enthusiasm.<br>
         But if after completion one changes, <br>
         There is no blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is a bad thing for a man to let himself be deluded by enthusiasm.
    But if this delusion has run its course, and he is still capable of changing,
    then he is freed of error. A sober awakening from false enthusiasm is
quite    possible and very favorable.</p>
