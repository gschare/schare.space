<h1>䷒  Hexagram 19. Lin / Approach</h1>
<title>䷒  Hexagram 19. Lin / Approach</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  The Chinese word lin has a range of meanings that is not exhausted
    by any single word of another language. The ancient explanations in the
  Book  of Changes give as its first meaning, "becoming great." What becomes
  great  are the two strong lines growing into the hexagram from below; the
  light-giving  power expands with them. The meaning is then further extended
  to include the concept of approach, especially the approach of what is
lower.   Finally the meaning includes the attitude of condescension of a
man in high   position toward the people, and in general the setting to work
on affairs.   This hexagram is linked with the twelfth month (January-February),
when after  the winter solstice, the light power begins to ascend again.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  APPROACH has supreme success.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.<br>
         When the eighth month comes,</p>
                         
  <p>.  There will be misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful progress.
    Spring is approaching. Joy and forbearance bring high and low nearer
together.     Success is certain. But we must work with determination and
perseverance    to make full use of the propitiousness of the time. And on
thing more: spring    does not last forever. In the eighth month the aspects
are reversed. Then    only two strong, light lines are left; these do not
advance but are in retreat   (see next hexagram). We must take heed of this
change in good time. If we   meet evil before it becomes reality-before it
has even begun to stir-we  can  master it.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  The earth above the lake:<br>
         The image of APPROACH.<br>
         Thus the superior man is inexhaustible<br>
         In his will to teach,<br>
         And without limits<br>
         In his tolerance and protection of the people.</p>
                         
  <p>  The earth borders upon the lake from above. This symbolizes the approach
    and condescension of the man of higher position to those beneath him.
The    two parts of the image indicate what his attitude toward these people
will    be. Just as the lake is inexhaustible in depth, so the sage is inexhaustible
    in his readiness to teach mankind, and just as the earth is boundlessly
  wide,  sustaining and caring for all creatures on it, so the sage sustains
  and cares  for all people and excludes no part of humanity.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>   Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Joint approach.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The good begins to prevail and to find response in influential circles.
    This in turn is an incentive to men of ability. IT is well to join this
  upward  trend, but we must not let ourselves be carried away by the current
  of the  time; we must adhere perseveringly to what is right. This bring
  good  fortune.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Joint approach.<br>
         Good fortune.<br>
         Everything furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  When the stimulus to approach comes from a high place, and when a
man has the inner strength and consistency that need no admonition, good
fortune will ensue. Nor need the future cause any concern. He is well aware
that everything earthly is transitory, and that a descent follows upon every
rise, but need not be confused by this universal law of fate. Everything
serves to further. Therefore he will travel the paths of life swiftly, honestly,
    and valiantly.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Comfortable approach.<br>
         Nothing that would further.<br>
         If one is induced to grieve over it,<br>
         One becomes free of blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Things are going well for a man: he achieves power and influence.
But in this lies the danger that he may relax, and confident of his position,
    allow the easygoing, careless mood to show itself in his dealings with
 other   people. This would inevitably be harmful. But there is possibility
 of a change  of mood. If he regrets his mistaken attitude and feels the
responsibility     of an influential position, he frees himself of faults.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Complete approach.<br>
         No blame.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  While the three lower lines indicate rise to power and influence,
the three upper lines show the attitude of persons in higher position toward
those of lower rank for whom they procure influence. Here is shown the open-minded
    approach of a person of high rank to a man of ability whom he draws in
 to   his own circle, regardless of class prejudice. This is very favorable.
   </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Wise approach.<br>
         This is right for a great prince.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A prince, or anyone in a leading position, must have the wisdom to
    attract to himself people of ability who are expert in directing affairs.
    His wisdom consists both in selecting the right people and in allowing
 those   chosen to have a free hand without interference from him.  For only
 through   such self-restraint will he find the experts needed to satisfy
all of his   requirements.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Great hearted approach.<br>
         Good-hearted approach.<br>
         Good fortune. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  A sage who has put the world behind him and who in spirit has already
    withdrawn from life may, under certain circumstances, decide to return
 once   more to the here and now and to approach other men. This means great
 good   fortune for the men whom he teaches and helps. And for him this great
 hearted   humbling of himself is blameless.</p>
