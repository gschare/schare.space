<title>䷔  Hexagram 21.  Shih Ho / Biting Through</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
         below  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>   This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram <a href="27.html">27</a> with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between
    the teeth. As a result the lips cannot meet. To bring them together one
  must  bite energetically through the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made
  up of  the trigrams for thunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles
  are  forcibly removed in nature.<br>
         Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining
   of  the lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing
    tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances
    of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme
  of  this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of
  <a href="6.html">Sung,  CONFLICT</a>, which refers to civil suits.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  BITING THROUGH has success.<br>
         It is favorable to let justice be administered.</p>
                         
  <p>  When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings
success. This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established,
the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and
blocking the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be
taken at once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its
own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
 However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines
Li, clarity, and Chên, excitement. Li is yielding, Chên is hard.
Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out punishment;
unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two together create
the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes the decisions (represented
    by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by
his    conduct in his position.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder and lighting:<br>
         The image of BITING THROUGH.<br>
         Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws<br>
         Through clearly defined penalties.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The lawsspecify
    the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severepenalties are differentiated,
    according to the nature of the crimes.This is symbolized by the clarity
  of  lighting. The law is strengthenedby a just application of penalties.
 This  is symbolized by the terrorof thunder. This clarity and severity have
 the  effect of instillingrespect; it is not that the penalties are ends
in  themselves.The  obstructions in the social life of man increase when
there  is alack of clarity  in the penal codes and slackness in executing
them.The  only to strengthen  the law is to make it clear and make penaltiescertain
 and swift.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  His feet are fastened in the stocks,<br>
         So that his toes disappear.<br>
         No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong,
    the penalty is a mild one.  Only the toes are put in the stocks.  This
 prevents   him from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame. 
It  is a warning   to halt in time on the path of evil.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six  in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Bites through tender meat,<br>
         So that his nose disappears.<br>
         No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case;it
    is like biting through tender meat. But one encounters ahardened sinner,
   and, aroused by anger, one goes a little toofar. The disappearance of
the    nose in the course of the bitesignifies that indignation blots out
finer   sensibility. However,there is no great harm in this, because the
penalty  as such isjust.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six  in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Bites on old dried meat <br>
         And strikes on something poisonous.<br>
         Slight humiliation.  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and
    authority to do so.  Therefore the culprits do not submit.  The matter
 at   issue is an old one-as symbolized by salted game-and in dealing with
 it difficulties  arise.  This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the problem
 the punisher arouses  poisonous hatred against himself, and n this way is
 put in a somewhat humiliating  position.  But since punishment was required
 by the time, he remains free  of blame.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Bites on dried gristly meat.<br>
         Receives metal arrows.<br>
         It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties<br>
         And to be persevering.<br>
         Good fortune. </p>
                         
  <p>  There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to
    be punished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is necessary
    to be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties.
    If one knows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good
   fortune. The difficult task is achieved in the end.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Bites on dried lean meat.<br>
         Receives yellow gold.<br>
         Perseveringly aware of danger.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear.  Since
    we naturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like
 yellow   gold-that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the color
 of the   middle [the mean]. It is only by remaining conscious of the dangers
  growing   out of the responsibility we have assumed that we can avoid making
  mistakes.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,<br>
         So that his ears disappear.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who is incorrigible.
    His punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears disappear under it-that
    is to say, he is deaf to warnings. This obstinacy leads to misfortune.</p>
