<title>䷉  Hexagram 10. Lü / Treading [conduct]</title>

<p id="alternative">
</p>

<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
         below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of conducting
    oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake, the youngest daughter,
    is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon which
composure     correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the word
for the name    of the hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading upon
something. The  small   and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and strong
[Ch'ien]. The  direction   of movement of the two primary trigrams is upward.
The fact that  the strong   treads on the weak is not mentioned in the Book
of Changes, because it is   taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand
against the strong is not   dangerous here, because it happened in good humor
[Tui] and without presumption,   so that the strong man is not irritated
but takes it all in good part.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  TREADING. Treading upon the tail of the tiger.<br>
         It does not bite the man. Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that
    which is weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong
  and  worries it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the
weak,   because  the contact is in goof humor and harmless.  In terms of
a human  situation,  one is handling wild, intractable people. In such a
case one's  purpose will  be achieved if one behaves with decorum. Pleasant
manners succeed  even with  irritable people.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Heaven above, the lake below:<br>
         The image of TREADING.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low,<br>
         And thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.</p>
                         
  <p>  Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in
    the natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there
 are   necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about
 universal   equality. But it is important that differences in social rank
 should not  be arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class
struggle  are the inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external
differences  in rank correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner
worth forms   the criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order
reigns in society.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Simple conduct. Progress without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation is one in which we are still not bound by any obligations
    of social intercourse. If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them
  We  can quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and
make   not  demands on people.  The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill
but   progress.  A man finds himself in an altogether inferior position at
the  start. However,  he has the inner strength that guarantees progress.
If he  can be content with simplicity, he can make progress without blame.
When a man is dissatisfied  with modest circumstances, he is restless and
ambitious  and tries to advance,  not for the sake of accomplishing anything
worth while,   but merely in order  to escape from lowliness and poverty
by dint of his  conduct. Once his purpose  is achieved, he is certain to
become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore  blame attaches to his progress.
On the other hand, a man who is good at his  work is content to behave simply.
He wishes to make progress in order to accomplish something. When he attains
his goal,  he does something worth while, an all is well.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Treading a smooth, level course.<br>
         The perseverance of a dark man<br>
         Brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation of a lonely sage is indicated here. He remains withdrawn
    from the bustle of life, seeks nothing, asks nothing of anyone, and travels
    through life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content and does
 not   challenge fate, he remains free of entanglements.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A one-eyed man is able to see,<br>
         A lame man is able to tread.<br>
         He treads on the tail of the tiger.</p>
                         
  <p>  The tiger bites the man.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus does a warrior act on behalf of his great prince.</p>
                         
  <p>  A one-eyed man can indeed see, but not enough for clear vision. A
lame man can indeed treat, but not enough to make progress. If in spite of
such defects a man considers himself strong and consequently exposes himself
to danger, he is inviting disaster, for he is undertaking something beyond
his strength. This reckless way of plunging ahead, regardless of the adequacy
    of one's powers, can be justified only in the case of a warrior battling
   for his prince.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He treads on the tail of the tiger.<br>
         Caution and circumspection<br>
         Lead ultimately to good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This text refers to a dangerous enterprise. The inner power to carry
    it through is there, but this inner power is combined with hesitating
caution    in one's external attitude. This line contrasts with the preceding
line,   which is weak within but outwardly presses forward. Here one is sure
of ultimate   success, which consists in achieving one's purpose, that is,
in overcoming   danger by going forward.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
      <p>Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Resolute conduct.<br>
         Perseverance with awareness of danger.</p>
                         
  <p>  This refers to the ruler of the hexagram as a whole. One sees that
    one has to be resolute in conduct. But at the same time one must remain
  conscious  of the danger connected with such resoluteness, especially if
 it is to be  persevered in. Only awareness of the danger makes success possible.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs.<br>
         When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes.</p>
                         
  <p>  The work is ended. If we want to know whether good fortune will follow,
    we must look back upon our conduct and its consequences. If the effects
  are  good, then good fortune is certain. No one knows himself. It is only
  by the  consequences of his actions, by the fruit of his labors, that a
man  can judge  what he is to expect.</p>
