<h1>䷜  Hexagram 29. K'an / The Abysmal (Water)</h1>
<title>䷜  Hexagram 29. K'an / The Abysmal (Water)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
         below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It is one
    of the eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means
  a  plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is
closed    in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the
middle son.   The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative,
and thus K'an   develops. As an image it represents water, the water that
comes from above   and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving
rise to all life  on earth.   In man's world K'an represents the heart, the
soul locked up within the body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark--that
is, reason. The name of the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has
the additional meaning, "repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended
 to designate an objective situation to which one must become accustomed,
not a subjective attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means
either foolhardiness or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger;
it is a situation in which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine,
 and, like the water, he can escape if he behaves correctly.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  The Abysmal repeated.<br>
         If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,<br>
         And whatever you do succeeds.</p>
                         
  <p>  Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets
the example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and
on, and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not
shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make
it lose its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions.
    Thus likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the
  heart  can penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained
  inner  mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action
  we take  will succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out
all  that has  to be done--thoroughness--and going forward, in order not
to perish  through  tarrying in the danger.  Properly used, danger can have
an important  meaning  as a protective measure. Thus heaven has its perilous
height protecting  it  against every attempt at invasion, and earth has its
mountains and bodies    of water, separating countries by their dangers.
Thus also rulers make use   of danger to protect themselves against attacks
from without and against   turmoil within.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its foal:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of the Abysmal repeated.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue<br>
         And carries on the business of teaching.</p>
                         
  <p>  Water reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up every depression
    before it flows on. The superior man follows its example; he is concerned
    that goodness should be an established attribute of character rather
than     an accidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others
everything    depends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that
the pupil   makes the material his own.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Repetition of the Abysmal.<br>
         In the abyss one falls into a pit.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  By growing used to what is dangerous, a man can easily allow it to
    become part of him. He is familiar with it and grows used to evil. With
  this  he has lost the right way, and misfortune is the natural result.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The abyss is dangerous.<br>
         One should strive to attain small things only.</p>
                         
  <p>  When we are in danger we ought not to attempt to get out of it immediately,
    regardless of circumstances; at first we must content ourselves with
not    being overcome by it. We must calmly weigh the conditions of the time
and    by satisfied with small gains, because for the time being a great
success    cannot be attained. A spring flows only sparingly at first, and
tarries  for  some time before it makes its way in to the open.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.<br>
         In danger like this, pause at first and wait,<br>
         Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.<br>
         Do not act this way.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger. Escape is
    out of the question. Therefore we must not be misled into action, as
a  result   of which we should only bog down deeper in the danger; disagreeable
 as it   may be to remain in such a situation, we must wait until a way out
 shows  itself.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;<br>
         Earthen vessels</p>
                         
  <p>  Simply handed in through the Window.</p>
                         
  <p>  There is certainly no blame in this.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of danger ceremonious forms are dropped. What matters most
    is sincerity. Although as a rule it is customary for an official to present
    certain introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed,
 here   everything is simplified to the utmost. The gifts are insignificant,
 there   is no one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet all this need
 not be   humiliating if only there is the honest intention of mutual help
 in danger.   Still another idea is suggested. The window is the place through
  which light   enters the room. If in difficult times we want to enlighten
  someone, we must  begin with that which is in itself lucid and proceed
quite   simply from that  point on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The abyss is not filled to overflowing,<br>
         It is filled only to the rim.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Danger comes because one is too ambitious. In order to flow out of
    a ravine, water does not rise higher than the lowest point of the rim.
 So   likewise a man when in danger has only to proceed along the line of
least   resistance; thus he reaches the goal. Great labors cannot be accomplished
    in such times; it is enough to get out of the danger.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Bound with cords and ropes,</p>
                         
  <p>  Shut in between thorn-hedged prison walls:<br>
         For three years one does not find the way.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man who in the extremity of danger has lost the right way and is
    irremediably entangled in his sins has no prospect of escape. He is like
   a criminal who sits shackled behind thorn hedged prison walls.</p>
