<h2 id="modern-art-anyone-can-paint-top"><span id="art">Modern Art:
Anyone Can Paint</span> <span class="tinytop"><a href="#">top</a></span></h2>
<p>During a recent visit to MoMA I saw this 1948 piece by Alfredo
Hlito:</p>
<p><span id="hlito"></span> <a href="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/hlito-big.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/hlito.png" alt="Curves and Straight Series"></a></p>
<p>This painting to me evokes <strong>balance</strong>. The strokes have
a satisfying precision to them, as if made by machine, yet unmistakeably
the work of hand. The canvas is a bit crinkled, as if worn—I’m not quite
sure if this is a sign of age or if it is a property of the
material.</p>
<p>Then, a young girl—maybe 6 or 7—came by holding a smartphone and
started taking photos of Hlito’s painting and the other modern art
pieces around it. “I could draw that,” she exclaimed, looking at
Rothfuss’s Yellow Quadrangle, and her father trailing behind said, “I
think you could draw that too.” This is the painting she was looking
at:</p>
<p><span id="rothfuss"></span> <a href="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/rothfuss-big.jpg"><img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/rothfuss.png"></a></p>
<p>Once she got her photo, her father rushed her along—“come on, let’s
go.” The self-assured journeyman art historian in me regrets that the
girl blew through the gallery room in under ten seconds; if she stayed
longer, maybe I’d have made up my mind to capitalize on the teachable
moment. I could say, “first of all, it’s a painting, not a drawing, so
you couldn’t draw that—maybe you could paint that.” No, what a terrible
snide thing to say!</p>
<p>I would begin not by correcting but by expanding her understanding of
the piece: “it’s not just a drawing; do you see that it is 3D?” Thus
revealing what basic details you can appreciate when you take a little
more time looking, and use your body instead of your monocular camera
lens to view the work.</p>
<p>Yellow Quadrangle has balance like Hlito’s piece, but weightier and
easier to dissect. The weight comes from the large colored blocks, of
course, and from the material: a thick board cut and painted such that
the blocks are outset. Where Hlito created a painting, flat and
unassuming, Rothfuss created an object with mass, scale, and texture.
Both could be hung in a rich household’s living room. These remarks are
obvious. A child could tell you that. I like to imagine that, if asked
to comment on her observations, this girl I saw would notice the same
things as me. That, I think, is what distinguishes Rothfuss (and
Mondrian, and others from this school): their art is for everyone. They
are completely unsubtle. Everyone can appreciate what makes Yellow
Quadrangle good. The formal elements of the composition shout at you,
“this is who I am! this is what I’m doing!” The art itself is
didactic.</p>
<p>This takes a lot of effort, I imagine. Usually, when someone remarks,
“I could draw that,” with regard to a Mondrian or a Pollock, it is
intended as a negative judgment on the piece and on modern art as a
whole. Art should be difficult to create, they think. It should take
skill. Doesn’t Yellow Quadrangle take skill? I presume there is a lot of
trial and error and design sense (that intuition which only comes from
experience) behind the careful composition. The blocks are unbalanced,
but arranged as they are, though precarious, they attain balance. They
evoke a house of cards, or a jenga tower: right now a local minimum, a
low-energy stable configuration, the next moment knocked into chaos by a
small perturbation. Yet it feels calming and orderly. So perfect, it
could never fall apart.</p>
<p>That sounds difficult to compose from scratch. But, wonderfully, it’s
very easy to <em>copy</em>. Any kid can take a piece of paper and some
colored pencils or crayons and render their own copy of Yellow
Quadrangle without much fuss. They would get <em>very close</em> to a
perfect flat projection of Rothfuss’s piece, modulo the precise colors
and texture. The more experience you have and the more tools at your
disposal, the sharper your lines, the closer you get to an exact
copy—never quite perfect but good enough to make you feel you
participated, you were able to <em>create something</em>. And once you
see the pattern (the sense of balance is inherent, deeply ingrained in
our brains) you too can go through the process of trial and error to
create your own <em>unique</em> composition <em>without any special
skills required</em> beyond the ability to draw a straight line and
color in shapes. I think this is why people say, “I could draw that!” to
Mondrian and Rothfuss, or to Pollock’s splatter canvases. They mean it.
They’re right. They can draw it. So why is it said as if intended to be
a putdown?</p>
<p>I bet the girl heard similar remarks and echoed them in that parrot
habit kids have. She was trying out how it feels to utter the common
refrain against modern art. In my experience saying that sort of thing
(all of us have done it) it feels hollow, like I have not gotten to the
bottom of what’s going on, and I’ve settled for a lazy dismissal instead
of pursuing understanding or cultivating appreciation. I hope it felt
hollow for her to say it, too, and I hope she elects at some point to
make more of an effort to see what’s in front of her. That being said, I
empathize with those who say it seriously. I understand having this
reaction to an art world that emphasizes obscurity and admits only
interpretations available to those with a wealth of knowledge of art
history. That’s exactly why I find non-representational art (and related
movements) so exciting: they are essentially a rejection of this
elitist, exclusionary trend within the art industry and the stuffiness
of private ownership. Abstract art is great to have in museums because
it is, in a way, the epitomic “art for the people.”</p>
<p>Or perhaps nothing need be taught, perhaps there is nothing to be
fixed. The little girl’s exclamation, “I could draw that!” was not a
critique. Children are honest about how the world around them makes them
feel. We can interpret her differently. She was saying how excited this
piece made her, how it told her she could be an artist too, how it was
relatable, how she could imagine herself creating it. That intuitive
reaction is far more valuable than any pretentious lecture on modern
art. Unlike most artists and critics, she engaged directly with the work
and announced her reaction to it. That is priceless.</p>

<p>Comfort is no comfort to me anymore. Instead I seek experiences to
add to my collection.</p>
<p><span id="prospect"></span> <img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/lie.jpg"></p>
<p>There is astonishing beauty everywhere I go—even the ugly places. The
light which lends the world its colors moves too quickly; it resists my
pleas to stay put and my prayers that every moment would last a
century.</p>
<p><span id="beach"></span> <img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/beach.jpg"></p>
<p>I am best at sitting still when everything around is in motion. Those
who seek to capture the world must be great observers, recording each
moment, dutifully reshelving life into fiction. They write a story, or
click a shutter, or jot a poem, and each capture is an nonequivalent
exchange transferring the outer world into their inner. If not theft, it
is informational piracy.</p>
<p><span id="subway"></span> <img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/subway1.jpg"></p>
<p>Such a person is not of the world. Where do they live?</p>
<p><span id="stones"></span> <img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/stones3.jpg"></p>
<p>Do they stand above us looking down, taking remarkable fragments up
to a higher shelf like a messenger whispering in the ears of a greater
power? Does their attention dignify us?</p>
<p><span id="rana"></span> <img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/rana.jpg"></p>
<p>Or do they stand among us, aloof, pretending at artistry while in
fact no wiser or fuller than those of us who live in the world?</p>
<p><span id="uris"></span> <img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/uris.jpg"></p>
<p>A hundred moments captured, a thousand noted, a million moments slip
me by. A moment captured, I’ve found, festers rotten unused. Ripped from
its context, experienced flat instead of full, memory fading; this is no
way to treat a slice of life. Make something your own of it, urgently,
or let it go free.</p>

<p>David Bieber of Google hosted a hack session at Betaworks. Omar and
Andrés were there. A founder called Michael Fischer was there. And I was
there. Michael came up to me and introduced himself and we spoke about
his startup, <a href="https://waterbear.science">waterbear.science</a>,
a blockchain for scientific datasets designed to reward scientists for
publishing their data and for using open data to generate insights.
Aside from my default aversion to blockchain (really a reaction to
recent years’ cryptocurrency overhype), it seems rather neat. But a
startup? Why must everything be profitable? Do we not profit from
apparently useless activities, personal experiments guided not by
feasibility but by curiosity? Another attendee at David’s event, whose
name tragically escapes me, related to us her personal project on
organizing all her notes from autodidactically exploring the 17th
century… and discovering blind spots in her research using a custom
tensorflow model trained on Wikipedia links. The latter part of the
project sounded less like a robust technical solution to a serious
problem and more like an elaboration of the question, “I wonder if this
is possible…?” I have abundant respect for this sensibility.</p>

<h2 id="homework-top"><span id="homework">Homework</span> <span class="tinytop"><a href="#">top</a></span></h2>
<p>I opened up <em>The Lathe of Heaven</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> for
the second time. The first time I opened it in Prospect, leaning against
a tree on an early warm day of spring. A serendipitous <a href="https://twitter.com/disconcision/status/1767598077135749547">Tweet
from Andrew Blinn</a> let me know it was divinely ordained that I read
it. Kelly Linker’s preface compelled me forwards, and the jellyfish
stopped me in my tracks. I put it off for later.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Later has arrived. At Eden’s recommendation, I continued past the
first page and found something remarkable. In <em>Lathe</em>, Le Guin
deftly develops the mechanics of a sci-fi concept, called “effective
dreaming,” through a series of therapy sessions featuring the central
characters. But so far, halfway through the book, I am most impressed
how Le Guin employs shifting the close third perspective from character
to character to further the plot and the reader’s understanding of the
central “technology” of effective dreaming. I cannot help but read Le
Guin’s books with an eye towards the craft of writing. Here, I find it
instructive to imagine removing some formal element. If Le Guin omitted
the changing perspective and focused entirely on the interiority of
George Orr, the book might benefit from the added ambiguity about the
reliability of his account, but we would lose a much more interesting
aspect of the concept: the bystander’s perspective of his dreams. Though
initially surprised that she clears the ambiguity so quickly, I now
appreciate the choice to focus on each character’s experience of
effective dreaming.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/lathe.jpg"></p>
<p>Once I finish the book I expect I will have something to say about
the details of the futuristic Portland outlined by Le Guin. I found
myself ready to levy critique against her naive vision of
post-automobile globally-warmed North America, but when George dreamed
of the Plague Years, I realized there was not just one future described
in <em>Lathe</em>, but many conflicting futures. An analysis of her
world-building becomes correspondingly more complex.</p>
<p>My own fault—it slipped my mind—I did not invite Eden to annotate the
book before she returned it to me. I’ll get another chance with the
<em>Bhagavad Gita</em> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> if I borrow her copy. Do you know
this? That you must ask your friends to annotate the books you lend
them? Then reading becomes a delayed conversation. Shira was kind enough
to carefully annotate <em>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</em> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> for me. It is just as lovely to
receive a copy <em>annotated</em> as it is to receive one <em>annotated
for you</em>. The difference is the intention: am I annotating for
myself (and you happen to read it after me), or for you? Both ways
enable the intimacy of reading together separately.</p>
<p>I also re-read <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. It
is rare that I allow myself to read in the way I did: opening specific
chapters and reading portions, jumping around, reminding myself,
following curiosity rather than linear page progression. I now believe
this is a wonderful way to re-read. Once you know the scope of a book,
you can return to it like an old friend, and jump around to bits and
pieces you remember, reading just as much as you please, discovering new
connections and allowing yourself to revel in the prose.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, I came to re-read <em>A Wizard of
Earthsea</em> because I wanted to share a passage out loud. This, too,
is one of the unique intimacies afforded by sharing a book with others.
It is just as well to send a picture of some compelling passage over the
internet… though I do take pleasure in reading aloud.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tidings/pretending/wizard.jpg"></p>
<p>I have been slowly flipping through <em>Lost In Thought</em> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> by Zena Hitz every time I have a
spare moment. It has served a consistent function for me: a frequent
reminder that my most tightly-held and important mission is learning.
This takeaway is compounded by the fact that I’m reading this treatise
on the dignity of everyday intellectual inquiry while riding the subway,
waiting in line, or, indeed, sitting on the toilet. Now that I’ve
finished it, I have a broader perspective on Hitz’s overall argument and
I can take issue with this concluding argument:</p>
<div class="fancyquote">
<blockquote>
<p>Scholarship is exciting in its own right, but it means nothing in a
world where there is no first-order reflection, no ordinary thinking
about human nature or the structure and origins of the world. Higher
study is pointless if literature or philosophy or mathematics or the
nature of nature has ultimately nothing to do with the human good of
ordinary people or with paths of understanding one might follow in daily
life.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>I’m not convinced that Hitz is correct here! Her central assumption
seems to be that the topics of study in intellectual institutions should
be mere elaborations of matters accessible to the layman pondering the
cosmos on his daily walk. Or that it should be possible to trace every
activity in the university to a purpose that somehow benefits the
everday intellectual. While noble to imagine every academic question
participates in the grand quest for universal human truths, I am not
sure that is a good idea. Certainly, intellectual institutions often
invent their own reasons to exist, but they also often do work that is
simply difficult to justify from basic principles because it is so
technical. Specialized division of labor (in this case, intellectual
labor) allows us to create and use technology (in this case, advanced
and niche research techniques) that simply would not be possible in the
good old days of Plato’s Academy. This is a good thing because it means
we can answer important technical questions without getting bogged down
in the need to tie our work to the universal questions of the human
condition. Sometimes we really just want to know how to assign processor
registers efficiently in a compiler, and so we invent tons of niche
jargon and obscure techniques just for this purpose. That this bolsters
other research and development is a good enough reason for it to be
studied.</p>
<p>But Hitz’s argument is largely a defense of the humanities; my point
holds for the humanities, too! It is totally appropriate, I think, for a
scholar concerned with the details of post-Marxist philosophers’ uptake
of Hegelian dialectics to use jargon that is neither known nor relevant
to the everyday intellectual. Even if, after a thorough audit of such an
endeavor, all we can come up with for a reason to exist is better
understanding of the origin of dialectics as invoked today, intellectual
inquiry retains the dignity about which Hitz is so concerned.</p>
<p>For a book that seems to be one big complaint about grant-writing,
its conclusion seems to be little more than a suggestion for how to pick
academic research topics that sound good on grant applications. Perhaps
that is unfair. In fact, I felt this was tangential to her actual gripes
with academia. In an earlier passage also in the final chapter, Hitz
reveals the real frustration that motivated her to write this book:</p>
<div class="fancyquote">
<blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, I came across a hundred-year-old scholarly edition of
the <em>Annals</em> of Sennacherib… The introduction broached the human
question most evidently raised by the work—the corrupting force of
absolute military and political power:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>History begins with the vanity of kings. (Will it end with the vanity
of the demos?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scholars today are both too sophisticated and too diffident to appeal
to such an obvious, profound, and universal question in a work meant for
specialists. They hide the human under jargon, or lose sight of it
altogether.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Firstly, I believe you can write this way. If it sparks joy in you,
it probably sparks joy in Reviewer #2 (who is, lest we forget, a
colleague and also an academic!). Secondly, this quote, too, is
technical jargon! It just happens to be relevant to scholars of ancient
political philosophy… such as Zena Hitz. Perhaps this is why she focuses
so intently on “universal questions” of humanity: they are the subject
of her particular field of study. Other fields, like programming
languages or Hegelian dialectics, may be able to employ rhetoric to
argue for their grand importance but ultimately must contend with their
relatively narrow domain—especially when your research programme deals
with the technical details rather than the mass appeal, which is usually
the case in academia, by design.</p>
<p>So, I interpret the book differently. Rather than suggesting “higher
study is pointless if [it has] nothing to do with […] ordinary people or
[…] daily life,” Hitz, by her own example, implores us to uncomprisingly
defend the value of our intellectual work and to rely on the virtue of
seriousness as a source of dignity and communion in an otherwise
humiliating and fragmented world of false needs.</p>
