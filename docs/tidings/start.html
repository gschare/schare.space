Trying A New Thing
</title>
<p>Dear <a href="/assets/img/tidings/start/cartwheel.jpg">Cartwheel</a>,</p>
<p>For a long while now I’ve been working up the courage to writing
something approximating a blog. You being a cat and all, I wouldn’t
expect you to understand my hesitation, let alone my motivation.</p>
<p>But then I see you staring at the ceiling fan, wondering how it is I
manipulate light with the pull of a chain, mystified, learning, and I
know there is more to you than I give you credit for.</p>
<p>Pretense is counterproductive to writing. But Cartwheel, I have
nothing to prove to you.</p>
<p>Here is what I’ve been thinking about lately.</p>

The Expression Problem <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>Okay, Cartwheel, you know Haskell, right?</p>
<p>No?</p>
<p>I recently came across a <a href="https://cohost.org/prophet/post/4979906-i-don-t-think-people">short
post</a> that helped me understand the raison d’être for
<code>forall</code> types in Haskell.</p>
<p>Imagine you are developing a library and you model your domain with
some abstract data types. Perhaps you define some simple shapes:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Circle</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Circle</span> <span class="dt">Float</span> <span class="dt">Float</span> <span class="dt">Float</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="kw">deriving</span> (<span class="dt">Show</span>, <span class="dt">Read</span>, <span class="dt">Eq</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Rectangle</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">Rectangle</span> <span class="dt">Float</span> <span class="dt">Float</span> <span class="dt">Float</span> <span class="dt">Float</span></span>

<p>You want to give your users something to do with these shapes. All
2-dimensional shapes have an area, so you write a function to produce
the area by pattern-matching on the ADTs and–</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>area (<span class="dt">Circle</span> _ _ r) <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="fu">pi</span> <span class="op">*</span> r <span class="op">^</span> <span class="dv">2</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>area (<span class="dt">Rectangle</span> x y x' y') <span class="ot">=</span> (<span class="fu">abs</span> <span class="op">$</span> x <span class="op">-</span> x') <span class="op">*</span> (<span class="fu">abs</span> <span class="op">$</span> y <span class="op">-</span> y')</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---- end of file.</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">----- REPL output:</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>&lt;interactive&gt;:16:7: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘Circle’
                  with actual type ‘Rectangle’
    • In the pattern: Rectangle x y x' y'
      In an equation for ‘area’:
          area (Rectangle x y x' y') = (abs $ x - x') * (abs $ y - y')</code></pre>
<p>Prophet’s post suggested the natural instinct is to define the shapes
as components of a sum type, which would make the above code valid at
the expense of extensibility. In the interest of allowing us to add more
shapes later—or even extend the library in userspace—we should use a
typeclass.</p>
<p>This issue of extensibility is part of the so-called “Expression
Problem” to which type classes are one solution. I think it is a pretty
good solution; writing typeclasses is not too much extra code (it often
reduces code!) and they are not too much trouble to understand. They are
a nice implementation of a critical idea in programming languages—that
data can be associated with behavior in quite complex and overlapping
ways.</p>
<p>So you express the idea that all shapes have an area using a
typeclass, since this is the idiomatic solution.</p>

<p>The solution is Existential Types. These types form an opaque,

<p>There is something going on here. Abstract data types, classes,
objects, type classes—they all answer the same questions about how to
structure our data in modular and extensible ways. <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ClosuresAndObjectsAreEquivalent">Objects are a
poor man’s closure, closures are a poor man’s object</a>; and the same
holds true for type classes and mixins.</p>
<p>Now I wonder: what programming problem do dependent types solve? And
what object-oriented solution was already invented in the 70s that the
finest type theorists refuse to acknowledge?</p>
<p>To be honest with you, Cartwheel, I have no quarrel with the type
theorists. They are my friends and colleagues, my heroes and mentors. I
spend all day writing complex types in Ur/Web. I find the connections
between OOP and FP quite fascinating and exciting—beautiful, even.</p>
<h2 id="language-feel"><a href="#language-feel">#</a> Language Feel <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>I recently wrote a small but complex program in Racket using Geiser
in Emacs as my IDE. I usually program in Python or Haskell, but I have a
bit of experience in Racket. Cartwheel, these languages feel <em>so
different</em>.</p>
<p>Every language has a gimmick or two. Java’s gimmick is
garbage-collected objects on a virtual machine. Haskell’s gimmick is
laziness and types. Python’s gimmick is dynamism and simplicity. What is
Racket’s gimmick? As far as I know, it is <em>macros and languages</em>.
Insofar as there is a “right” way to write Racket, the right way is to
create small DSLs that help you express solutions to your problem and
properly encode the semantics of your domain. I did not do this.</p>
<p>Even with the REPL giving me wonderful affordances, writing Racket
felt like floating on air. By contrast, Haskell feels solid,
rectilinear, geometric. When I write Haskell, I plan out entire programs
by first modeling the types and function signatures and iterating on
those before I write a single line of implementation. Haskell makes me
feel like an architect, sketching out a blueprint.</p>
<p>Why is this? Working in a richly typed language is like having a
conversation with the compiler. The machine assists you, keeps you on
track and consistent—but punishes exploration and digression and
disorganization. This is a tradeoff I happen to appreciate.</p>
<p>In Racket, I tend to be more hare-brained. I jump around writing
little fragments of code, leaving unfinished expressions and throwing
out ideas haphazardly. Racket’s homoiconicity and the liveness of the
Geiser notebookish interface certainly encouraged this behavior.</p>
<p>Here is another point for the validity of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
in programming. If we take the phenomenon seriously, can we design
languages with intention surrounding the style of programming they
encourage?</p>
<p>Programming languages and cognitive science, as fields of study,
began at the same time out of the same groups of people thinking about
intelligence and human augmentation. Now they feel separated by a wide
gap, and we pretend they are not related. I am glad <a href="https://willcrichton.net/">Will Crichton</a> is interested in
bringing the insights of cognitive science to programming languages.</p>
<p>Given the stunted state of programming—we appear to be stuck with the
assumptions and affordances of the 80s—I fear we are not ready for the
revolution in programming heralded by LLMs. I fear the immaturity of our
tools for expressing ourselves computationally leaves us unprepared to
make full use of the technology of generative AI. This makes it all the
more exciting to be working on programming languages right now: the
stakes are high for the future of programming.</p>
<h2 id="office-spaces"><a href="#office-spaces">#</a> Office Spaces <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>The gruesome banality of suburban office parks holds me with a morbid
rapture. Caught in the emptiness between a freakishly large parking lot,
a measly green patch with a twiggy tree, and the dull brown brick of a
4-story anonymous office building, I’m searching everywhere for beauty.
In its stead, might nostalgia suffice?</p>
<p>In the TV show <cite>Adventure Time</cite>, villains like Ice King
are redeemable, but (spoilers) the final boss is a being of pure chaos.
Evil lies on a spectrum with good, implying the ability to become evil
from good and good from evil. We all possess some notion of evil. We are
capable of understanding evil. Evil is often human. But not chaos. Chaos
is unhuman, incomprehensible, the awful marriage of power and ignorance.
Evil is drama, but chaos is the tragedy of absurdity. We prefer the wise
tyrant to the dangerous fool. For examples of the former acting as
defender of the realm against the latter, see <cite>Adventure
Time</cite>’s Ice King, <cite>Dark Messiah</cite>’s Arantir,
<cite>Succession</cite>’s Logan, and <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion?from=Main.EvilVsOblivion">this
TV Tropes page</a>.</p>
<p>The modern design trends of offices—the international Airbnb style,
the coffee shop consensus, the WeWork—are not evil. They augur nought
but chaos, idiocy, dispassion, all that is antithetical to life. Not
autocratic narcissistic excess, but a worse fate for society: <a href="https://chriscutrone.platypus1917.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/horkheimer_littlemanphilosophyfreedomdaemmerung1926-31.pdf">attrition
to the inefficiencies of capitalism without a rational agent which can
yoke alien law to human will</a>. A death heralded by <a href="https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average">the age
of average</a>. It is always boring before the end.</p>
<p>How I yearn for the days of olde! When the designers and architects
of the mid-century promised technological solutions to social ills. When
every office worker was a patient, and Eames and Herman Miller were the
doctors dealing in cures.</p>
<p>I’ve been invited to apply to live in MIT’s brand new graduate
student dorm, “Graduate Junction” by American Campus Communities.
Please, Cartwheel, please tell me who in the world thought I would want
to live in a building where the lobby looks like <a href="/assets/img/tidings/start/grad-junction1.jpg">this</a> and <a href="/assets/img/tidings/start/grad-junction2.jpg">this</a>?</p>

<p>The stark light of a yellow star pierces through the windows of a
lonely spaceship, illuminating crumpled bedsheets in the crew quarters,
splaying a sunbeam on the pristine cream-colored floor. A bustling
market on a remote lunar outpost is host to merchants, criminals,
troublemakers and all the rabble dropped there by circumstance and
misfortune. Scrappy scavengers laugh over a hearty meal in the mess hall
on their old, beaten-up planethopper. Brave explorers on a five-year
mission have a moment of respite during shore leave in a Federation
solar system. Love blossoms in the vacuum of space. I want to call this
<em>cozy sci-fi</em>.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, Cartwheel, but you’re just not the right audience for

sci-fi, but that kind of research takes time and effort and I’d prefer
to publish something sooner.</p>
<p>I can say one thing right now: it is not a difficult leap between the

<p>In <em>Tacoma</em>, the para-protagonists live on a company space
station under conditions of extreme corporate negligence. But cozy
spaces like this one are in no short supply. They indicate the
indominable human will to adapt, to find comfort and home no matter the
situation. Every personal item conveys quiet rebellion and
uncompromising humanism in the face of perilous risk and injustice.

<p>In <em>Firefly</em>, the heroes (if you can call them that; they are
more like honorable thieves) live on a rusty but reliable spaceship
called <em>Serenity</em>. The 14 episodes of the show introduce the
audience to many aspects of daily life on the craft, including
warmly-lit communal crew dinners in the kitchen. Such moments feature
briefly on the show, but they imply that the crew develops strong bonds
of intimacy during long, isolating voyages. Furthermore, these human
rituals are crucial to the well-being of the protagonists, and they
prove that even the more grizzled crew members have deep compassion for
their shipmates. When they fall into danger, the audience may recall
these moments of familial comfort to understand why the crew of
<em>Serenity</em> will do anything to protect one another. Image source:

“Safe”).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tidings/start/firefly-objects-in-space.jpg"></p>
<p>The final episode of <em>Firefly</em> begins with a tour of the crew
engaged in quiet moments of leisure during a long and lonely voyage
through empty space. Here, Simon and Kaylee flirt in the passenger
quarters. <em>Serenity</em>’s pilot and second officer are married and
their dedicated companionship features prominently throughout the show.
<em>Firefly</em>’s image of sci-fi is full of romance, both in the
interpersonal sense and in the contentious romance of remaining outside
the law and living on the run. In the former case, Whedon frequently
chooses to portray romantic situations as cozy respite from the
difficult life of smugglers. Image source: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0579531/">IMDB</a> (Episode 14:
“Objects in Space”).</p>

<p>In season 2, episode 9 of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>,
several senior members of the crew play a game of poker together under
cozy lighting in their downtime. Similar to <em>Firefly</em>, the
protagonists are shown to have bonds of friendship that extend beyond
work and circumstance. These bonds are formed in moments of quiet
leisure just as much as they are formed in the crucible of challenging
situations. <em>TNG</em> takes the time to show us both sides to the
life aboard the <em>Enterprise</em>.</p>

<p>The crew quarters in <em>TNG</em> are beautiful imaginings of
spaceship interior decor, emblematic of the optimistic futurism that
permeates the show. They are luxurious and hospitable, inviting a sense
of comfort and personal space uncommon to life as crew on ships in the
world today. Windows out to space are the central feature of the
captain’s quarters—shown here—which is fitting given Captain Picard’s
contemplative demeanor. Image source: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708759/">IMDB</a>.</p>

<p>Tillie Walden’s <em>On A Sunbeam</em> is the crystallization of cozy
sci-fi. The webcomic’s protagonists are not smugglers or explorers, but
restorationists. Walden portrays life in space as often quiet, sometimes
dangerous, occasionally breathtaking, and always queer. I will let the
images speak for themselves. Image sources: <a href="https://www.onasunbeam.com/">On A Sunbeam</a>.</p>

<p>Cartwheel, I think you should learn to read. You are clearly highly
intelligent, and given how you like to attack me when you have the
zoomies, you are the apex predator. Why do cats not rule the earth and
run society? I suppose they do, in some ways, but let’s be honest:
humans did all the work. I wonder if it’s because you cats grow up so
quickly. A species with a long time to reach adulthood requires society
(or at least a village) to provide supportive structure for both the
parents and children to survive. I imagine these phenomena would
interact in a positive feedback loop: safety in society permits even
longer development, leading to smarter brains and then more society. It
seems cats reached a premature local maximum in species evolution.</p>
<p>Well, I have hope for you yet. Here’s some things I’ve been reading
so you can learn to be smart like me.</p>
