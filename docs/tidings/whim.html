<h3>Consumerism</h3>
<p>Before we go on, let me disclaim the cult of productivity pervading
America. When I promote productivity as a good thing, I do not mean you
should . My notion of productivity contrasts with consumption.
Productivity in the sense of “having a job” is, in fact,
consumptive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language reflects the monopoly of the industrial mode of production
over perception and motivation. . . . People who speak a nominalist
language habitually express proprietary relationships to work which they
have. All over Latin America only the salaried employees, whether
workers or bureaucrats, say that they have work; peasants say that they
do it: “Van a trabajar, pero no tienen trabajo.”</p>

workers and peasants; his predictions of the encroachment of consumerist
society into even the non-salaried classes have certainly come to pass
in the age of ubiquitous smartphones.)</p>
<p>I envision a departure from consumerist framing of work, towards a
reconfiguration of productivity as a convivial expansion of creativity,
to include prosocial (but not conventionally or entirely “creative”)
activities such as teaching and other forms of service.</p>

<!--  May 16, 2025 notes  -->
<p>This dichotomy challenges our understanding of nature. Society seems
to take it for granted that physics—indeed all the natural sciences—obey
coherent scientific laws which can be rendered in mathematics. That this
has worked so far —even as there remain vexing mysteries in cosmology,
nuclear physics, consciousness, and the foundation of mathematics
itself—is really a miracle and we would do well to appreciate that more
often.</p>
<p>For most of human history (“since the dawn of time!”), philosophy and
theology have spent significant effort grappling with the assumption
that the universe is inherently <em>unknowable</em>, and then a couple
hundred years ago we all started to realize you could measure and
calculate a lot of things, and you can use those calculations to build
tools that measure and calculate more precisely and more accurately, and
so on. And then Darwin killed God, Oppenheimer harnessed the power to
destroy worlds, we started to do scientific eugenics, etc. etc., we all
know the story and its consequences. So now we all live in an
enlightened world of reason, and all great advancements in science and
technology exploit the knowable structure of the universe, and science
is a process, so this train will just keep on going until we know
everything, control everything.</p>
<p>But then what happened to the conception of the unknowable universe?
And how exactly did we start believing in science?</p>
<p>My mom likes to say that religion was invented to provide
explanations for natural phenomena before science was discovered. Thus
casting science as the conclusion to a much longer dark age of reason.
Supposedly, science closed the lid on these old myths, the ones
involving a whimsical God who works in mysterious ways. Turns out that
was just ignorance. Now that we have science, we don’t need religion.
Even your spiritual needs can be upgraded into behavioral psychology,
made manageable with modern medicine, since humans are animals after
all, biological machines that can be mechanistically understood and
repaired and improved.</p>
<p>It’s compelling, this story of religion. Belief in a higher power was
just a stepping stone in anthropological history, but from the moment we
discovered fire we have been on a path to greater and greater knowledge
and power, thanks to our love of reason. And it explains why science
seems to be getting stronger while religion gets weaker. If religion was
always just a crude attempt to understand the natural world, of course
it has evolved to fit the times. Of course we have replaced trickster
deities with benevolent Abrahamic Gods who bestow upon us divine
knowledge of nature and promote reason and structure. The idea (the
hope) that the universe is knowable has always been there, just hidden,
inaccessibly, in the Godhead, until Socrates and St. Augustine and
Einstein <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> revealed the path. Some version of
this is embedded in most world religions. But religious thinking does
contain an unalienable core of faith, which is why we have to move
beyond it and truly embrace science.</p>
<p>So that is the story of religion that science has retroactively
applied to human history. Let us now consider the story of science.</p>
<p>That the history of science portrays frequent, radical refutations of
widely-accepted theories does not contradict the idea of a structured
universe. This story of scientific discovery upholds the validity of the
scientific method, the idea of a convergence on ground truth. Typically
it presumes that such a ground truth exists in the sense that scientific
models can explain and predict natural phenomena, and at the <em>very
least</em> it shrugs its shoulders at the notion of fact, saying that
scientific laws by definition only approximate empirically, and that
science has no opinion on the existence of a fundamentally fathomable
universe. Either way, you operate on the assumption that it works—and it
does work! My question is: aside from the empirical evidence for the
effectiveness of empirical evidence, why do we (epistemologically,
morally, aesthetically) believe the universe has structure in the first
place? <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course not everyone seems to <em>want</em> to believe this. For
one thing, the dominant contact point between science and society these
days is machine learning: a discipline whose most successful
technologies are fundamentally unknowable, each decision from a language
model comes from a “black box.” Or there’s problem that arise in a
purely formal setting, such as <code>P</code> vs <code>NP</code> in
computational complexity, which has the appearance of resisting
apprehension without explanation, except that it <em>feels</em> right
that they are unequal. Another: in the more speculative parts of
physics, you find quasi-scientific reconfigurations of the character of
a capricious God, like the notion that universal constants may change on
us, rendering all our empirical efforts pointless in the face of a
greater logic, one that may remain incalculable. Whether it emerges out
of religious inspiration or inconsistencies within our scientific
theories, there’s something alluring about universal whimsy.</p>
<p>And yet even the idea of an inconstant universe can be fathomed
scientifically, like theories of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-variation_of_fundamental_constants">time-varying
universal constants</a>. Complexity theorists’ inability to resolve
<code>P</code> vs <code>NP</code> may just indicate the immaturity of
our theory of complexity. And on the matter of artificial intelligence,
I have colleagues working hard to apply the science of uncertainty to
machine learning, so we may understand them yet again—albeit in the
regime of probability and statistical inference, the newest turn of
science, guesswork made rational through mathematics, an evolution which
seems to not merely extend science but recontextualize and recast
science itself as a stochastic process. An explanation for everything.
At every dead end, a new unifying theory.</p>

</figure>
<p>So the disagreement on this point, on whether nature is fundamentally
structured or fundamentally whimsical, rages quietly, surfacing only
indirectly, as debates over whether it is even possible to resolve
certain questions in our current frameworks, because the cult of
rationality has placed a taboo, not on not knowing, but on <em>not being
able to know</em>.</p>
<p>Last year we saw the release of <em>Nosferatu</em>, representing our
fear—our reluctant awareness—that there are places in which current
science holds no power, that there are things about reality that only
the occult manages to provide answers, due to a fraught social
epistemology of not-knowing or science’s inherent limitations…. Cinema,
with its remarkable ability to reflect the historical consciousness,
proves that we remain irresolute over the question of natural
reason.</p>
<p>E put it like this: in the year of our (empirically fathomable) lord
twenty twenty-five, the essential question of religion and philosophy is
simply whether you believe in a materialist or non-materialist
basis—basically, does spirit precede expression, or does spirit emerge
from expression?</p>
<p>Our spirit of reason (the belief in a rational world), our expression
of technology (exploiting universal structure). Layering this over our
story of science as the incremental evolution of empirical knowledge
from basic observation to sophisticated engineering, it seems that the
materialist basis is straightforwardly correct, and the other violates
causality. “Surely,” says Heidegger, “technology got under way only when
it could be supported by exact physical science.” Indeed that is
chronologically true, but it misses the historical truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern science . . . pursues and entraps nature as a calculable
coherence of forces. Modern physics is not experimental physics because
it applies apparatus to the questioning of nature. The reverse is true.
Because physics, indeed already as pure theory, sets nature up to
exhibit itself as a coherence of forces calculable in advance, it orders
its experiments precisely for the purpose of asking whether and how
nature reports itself when set up in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="cite">Martin Heidegger, “The Question Concerning
Technology,” in <em>in Martin Heidgger: Basic Writings</em>, ed. David
Farell Krell (1977)</span></p>
<p>While this idea is hardly surprising, it poses again the question:
why would physicists approach nature as a “coherence of calculable
forces”? Though it arrives at universal reason, early science is moved
by faith. “Modern physics is the herald,” Heidegger writes, “whose
origin is still unknown.” Here, “origin” refers not to the literally
earliest conception of the idea, but the rational basis for it, even if
applied retroactively.</p>
<p>Was science handed to us in a Promethean sense? Is it totally
contingent that we happened upon the keys to understanding the universe?
Is it inevitable, extrapolating from the course of anthropological
development, as we settle into agricultural societies and invent money,
which must be counted and calculated, giving us the conceptual tools to
measure, which are then reappropriated by curious proto-scientists who,
both well-fed and unburdened thanks to agrarian surplus, are free to
ponder the mysteries of nature? Is it built into our biology? Or is it
proof of our divine spark, revealing the inner fire leftover from
creation: something that we chose of our free will, not merely accepting
but <em>earning</em> the fruits of technology?</p>
<p>A simple answer: science is only useful if it subscribes to
reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the
baffling complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events
could be discovered. One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that
two rocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach the
ground at the same time. The laws of nature are concerned with such
regularities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="cite">Eugene Wigner, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of
Mathematics in the Natural Sciences”</span></p>
<p>This is practically a matter of semantics. We have <em>defined</em>
science as the domain of making predictions based on reasonable
assumptions of structure. And yet the miracle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is
something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational
explanation for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the <em>fact that science works</em> is the
mysterious part. This hole at the center of our rational donut is
serious enough that an entire field, philosophy of science, concerns
itself with it. But that field, too, rests on structure of a different
kind: philosophical structure of argumentation, perhaps less
compulsively rigorous than mathematics but not so different in its
logical motions, especially in the analytical parts.</p>
<p>It is either a natural inevitability or an incredible stroke of luck
that we have mathematics. Structure or whim. The more you believe in the
structure, the more you start to know. Can whim tell us anything at
all?</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s all I have for now.</p>
