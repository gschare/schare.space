<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Been a bit. This is <em>supposed</em> to be monthly, more or less,
but I get self-conscious about publishing on the internet. This one is
smaller and focused on what I’ve been consuming.</p>

<h2><a href="#you-will-not-find-me-on-goodreads">#</a> You will not find
me on GoodReads <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>I read Joan Didion’s <cite>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</cite>. A
literary friend of mine recommended I read her memoir but I found this
instead. Having been aware of her repute as a pioneer of narrative
nonfiction and generally being a woman-at-large in the writing world, I
was sure I would be in for a treat, but like a lot of classics, it
surprised me. I experienced a bit of the Citizen Kane effect, but I read
some contemporary reviews and recent retrospectives and pieced together
exactly why she was regarded as so revolutionary in her time.
Basically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Novel approach to journalism.</strong> The New Journalism
movement was just beginning, and its main innovation was bringing
literary devices and a narrative style to journalism, which went along
with an emphasis on immersive reporting.</p>
<p>Just as today, mainstream headlines felt out of touch with the youth
who comprised the voice of counterculture movements. Didion and her
peers went and spent time with their subjects, affording them to bring
not only deeper insights but also a personal connection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Subjectivity.</strong> Didion in particular, in this book
of essays, aligns her writing along the central theme of (to borrow a
famous line from the Yeats poem for which the book is named) “things
fall apart.” This was natural for Didion, who felt she was born with “a
presentiment of loss” and who experienced, apparently, nothing but
disillusionment after disillusionment from Sacramento to New York to Los
Angeles and back again.</p>
<p>She turns this cynicism against her subjects and writes biting
criticisms which are not without empathy. Again: a journalist going into
the place where everything is happening in the rumble of the 1960s, but
bringing her unique voice and perspective as a writer. This theme seemed
to resonate with Americans at the time, and the book enjoyed instant
mainstream critical acclaim.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s this detail, this highly critical tone of hers, that rubbed me
the wrong way at first while reading. I felt she was being unreasonably,
inexplicably cruel to her subjects, incommensurate with the time she
apparently spent with them. It was only from reading some of the reviews
of the book, which included biographical articles about her lifelong
personal struggles, that I realized she did not hold some particular
anathema towards the residents of San Bernadino or Haight-Ashbury, but
rather she was constant companion to a general despair that may or may
have been a reflection of the circumstances. And so there’s a
psychoanalytic logic to this scenario: who better to write about the
chaos, loss, and neuroticism of the 1960s than a writer who embodies it
all? This, the interleaving of the personal with the public and with the
political, the psychology of one generalized to all and of all contained
in one, is, I suppose, the point of New Journalism.</p>
<hr>
<p>I read <em>Tools for Conviviality</em> in pieces, as if I was being
passed, each day, one small card, the sum of which comprised the entire
book but on each one only a single sentence. It’s a surprisingly
tolerable way to read. But in my typical fashion I made a sprint for the
end in the last fifty pages. For that I went to MIT’s Dewey library one
afternoon and read a very old gray hardcover copy.</p>
<p><em>Tools for Conviviality</em> is one of those works which, aside
from whatever novel presentation of ideas it may put forth, finds a
great part of its value in being incredibly quotable. I have to wonder
if Ivan Illich optimized for this characteristic. The effect is that I
can, when searching for an argument to promote a humanistic approach to
technology (so scarcely found in STEM academia), reach for
<em>Tools</em> and quickly find some paragraph that authoritatively
addresses the exact matter at hand. To support this I wrote down <a href="/garden/books/conviviality.html">my favorite quotes organized by
topic</a>.</p>
<p>The book is densely written. Illich writes with precision but at such
a level of consistent abstraction that I found it preferable to read in
pieces. I found myself leaping with joy when he would come down from
mysterious, three page long discussions on the spiritual effects of
industrial production and address the concrete socioeconomic changes
that resulted from the adoption of high-speed public transit. Let me be
clear and say I do not mind this. It is to be expected from works of
theory. But it makes it difficult to recommend that people read this. I
certainly would not find this engaging or helpful had I not spent
several years studying philosophy like it was a full-time job. I think
what he has to say is crucial for any “technologist” to know, though, so
I guess the burden of this knowledge is that I have to find a way to
effectively communicate it.</p>
<hr>
<p>I read more Ursula K. Le Guin—<em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>, my
second of her science fiction novels, and fourth overall. Riveting to
read, beautiful and epic and understated.</p>
<hr>
<p>My other reading has been much less focused. I read bits here and
there of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></li>
<li><em>The Sun Also Rises</em></li>
<li><em>Ficciones</em></li>
<li><em>The Possessed</em> - which in turn convinced me to read some of
Isaac Babel’s <em>1920 Diary</em></li>
<li><em>A Pattern Language</em></li>
<li><em>Don Quixote</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m enjoying them all, and I jump around. I tend to be slow and
meandering for the first half of any given book, and then I devour the
latter half. I just wonder in which of these will I reach the inflection
point first?</p>

<h2><a href="#you-will-however-find-me-on-letterboxd">#</a> You will,
however, find me on Letterboxd <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>I saw:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crazy Rich Asians</strong> - I love this kind of movie; it’s
so familiar and comforting. Great for watching on a plane, which is how
I saw it.</li>
<li><strong>Paprika</strong> - I was delighted by the subversion of the
“detective with a dark past” trope; the soundtrack is stuck in my
head.</li>
<li><strong>Forbidden Planet</strong> - watched this on a movie night
with my co-op; fun to observe the obvious influence this had on later
sci-fi, especially Star Trek; also fun to see cinema that is closer to a
play than to modern film; I felt like an intellectual watching a film
that had such a deliberate pace and presentation of its story without
trying to make a whole thing out of it.</li>
<li><strong>Hit Man</strong> - fun!</li>
<li><strong>Dune 2</strong> - quite honestly, I was deeply disappointed
by its misapprehension of the source material, and the visuals did not
move me as much as the first movie.</li>
<li><strong>My Neighbor Totoro</strong> - proof that movies do not need
to submit to a restrictive notion of plot or conflict in order to be
compelling.</li>
<li><strong>Watership Down</strong> - in general I’m a huge fan of tales
of epic journeys, especially when they emphasize the perilous nature of
the quest. I appreciated the dedication to them actually being rabbits,
albeit rabbits with advanced social structures, as opposed to merely
recasting human society in the animal world (e.g., Bee Movie).</li>
<li><strong>Night on Earth</strong> - I liked the shots looking out the
window at the cities at night.</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong> - I didn’t think about the biblical flood
allusion until the very end.</li>
<li><strong>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong> - I didn’t think about
the biblical flood allusion until the very end. Wait–</li>
<li><strong>A Real Pain</strong> - c.f. <em>The Zone of Interest</em> in
the portrayal of a concentration camp.</li>
<li><strong>Perfect Days</strong> - yeah it’s pretty good.</li>
<li><strong>Nosferatu</strong> - I was both moved and confused by the
apparent thesis of the film, which states that supposedly modern and
rational society is helpless when confronted with the undeniable
darkness of the world and within us, whether that darkness takes the
form of repressed sexual desire, aristocratic oppression, belief in the
occult, or the brutality of plague. The observation seems accurate, but
I could not detect, in the ending, a positive statement about
modernity’s potential to resolve this internal conflict (without
recourse to barbarism, e.g. sacrifice). I felt there was a plea for a
modern cult of Isis, i.e., a suspension of the taboo on fertility and
death, but no solution, no arrow pointing foward. Perhaps,
characteristic of the horror genre there is not a resolution to this
quandary. A film can only ask the question, not answer it…</li>

<h2><a href="#putting-the-house-in-order">#</a> Putting the house in
order <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>The last few months my side quests have involved things like desks,
candles, notebooks, lamps, hand towels, and chalices.</p>
<p>I am on the lookout for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pop culture critics who have actual demands implied by their
analysis. Theorists should not just describe; they must
<em>prescribe</em>. Not follow, lead!</p>
<p>For example, if you are analyzing queer representation in television,
I want to see a strong normative claim about what would be truly
progressive and what just <em>appears</em> to be progressive.</p></li>
<li><p>Taxonomies of imaginary worlds. For example, <em>Flow</em> is not
acting alone. Who are its accomplices in the realization of
post-apocalyptic landscapes of a certain, elusive aesthetic
heritage?</p></li>
<li><p>New thoughts on social media. Reframing it. Rethinking
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Art about AI art (derogatory).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Good tidings.</p>
