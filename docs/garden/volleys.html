<h2>Informational Addendum</h2>
<p>The “lost card” refers to a missing first card sent by Eden that was
either destroyed en route or sent without the correct destination
address.</p>

<section id="carmel-first-volley" class="level2">
<h2>Carmel, First Volley</h2>
<p><span class="ed">A standard postcard. The front image is a
macrophotographic close-up of a walker’s moth. There is handwriting in
the margins.</span> insect 4 ur arachnid</p>
<p><span class="ed">Along the top margin of the card are words in small
blue ink.</span> Don’t tell me things have changed! Stay frozen till I
reach you!</p>
<p>Dear Eden,</p>
<p>Do you have coffee with those donuts?</p>
<p>What mentor are you talking about? I am in search of one. Sometimes I
worry it was supposed to be you. But I don’t think that’s true. Do I
make it true just by saying it?</p>
<p>What PDF did you send? I didn’t receive anything.</p>
<p><span class="ed">A drawing of a fish.</span> &lt;– Subcarangiform?
Also haha dead fish! Bret Victor would be pissed.</p>
<p>Love,<br> Carmel</p>

<h2>Eden, Volley the Second</h2>
<p><span class="ed">A small, weathered envelope, slightly damaged by
water, causing some ink to stain in like watercolor. Markings bleed
through from inside the envelope. It has been taped shut.</span></p>
<p><span class="ed">The stamp is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="ed">On the flap of the envelope are three
scratch-n-sniff stickers with the words, “HAM IT UP!” Upon inspection,
the scent does indeed appear to be ham. Each one has been adorned, in
purple ink, with unique legs. . . .</span></p>

<section id="carmel-volley-the-second" class="level2">
<h2>Carmel, Volley the Second</h2>
<p><span class="ed">A standard envelope, unadorned. Inside is a
postcard. The front image is Harvard Square. Two tiny faces, cut out of
paper, are taped on top of the image so it looks like they are in the
square. In the margin below, there is handwriting in small black
ink.</span> &lt;– Us when we reunite, except actually it should be in
New York (I will come soon! I promise!)</p>
<p>Dear Eden,</p>
<p>The lost cards! The false starts! You are the anti-Babel. Batuman
talks about this: how Isaac lamented the loss of the manuscripts. I
think I am like Isaac and you are not and this is the essential
difference between us—the impassable pass. I heard it was unbecoming to
cry over a missing water bottle, but I cannot help it. But you always
have an answer for it, and instead of a loss of faith. So I envy
you.</p>
<p><span class="ed">There are words on the address part of the
card.</span> I resist jealousy. A sin worse than lust in Dante’s
theology. I don’t need your ways of dealing with loss—I have my own. I
am running out of space so ask me about how I found my pen in Prospect
Park. <span class="ed">The last words, from “ask,” are squished into the
bottom right corner of the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="ed">Taped over the postage area is a twice-folded piece
of white paper, made into a square, like a stamp. Unfolded, it reveals a
message. The ink is different—blue instead of black—but the penmanship
is the same.</span></p>
<p>Stop trying to make me eat meat! I need to give you my veggie
lore.</p>
<p>You should listen to Joan Baez. Joan Didion writes about her. I
recently watched the Joan of Arc movie from the early 2000s. Do you have
any more Joans to tell me about?</p>
<p>You say you found God. Where is God? I’m not actively looking, but
I’m thinking maybe I should start.</p>
<p>WHEN IS YOUR ALBUM COMING OUT??!?</p>

<section id="eden-final-volley" class="level2">
<h2>Eden, Final Volley</h2>
<p><span class="ed">An envelope, less water-damaged but nevertheless
crumpled and of questionable structural integrity. Again, the postage
stamp is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. There is a crown drawn above the stamp.
The end of the flap appears to be cut short, and in its place there is a
clipping of a “get well soon” sympathy card, attached to the envelope
flap via masking tape, which also seals the envelope. . . .</span></p>
<p>. . . O’er the pink sea of postage, this letter shall fly. . . .</p>
<p><u>OBJECTS</u></p>
<p>I have recently enjoyed a lot:</p>
<p>- my illegible vape<br>
- mini Diet coke<br>
- Brita water thing<br>
- heavy scissors<br>
- google eyes (always)<br>
- small apples<br>
- basic toothbrush . . .</p>

<section id="carmel-final-volley" class="level2">
<h2>Carmel, Final Volley</h2>
<p><span class="ed">A regular envelope. Inside is a postcard. The front
image is a human eye. Flipping to theother side, the address space on
the right is filled with writing.</span></p>
<p>Not in a dream but in the revelation before<br>
I found the face of love is not a ham<br>
But a venomous snake<br>
(or two, entwined)</p>
<p><span class="ed">In the postage space, instead of a stamp, there is
yet again a square of paper. This time it is light reddish-brown in
color. Removing the tape reveals it is not folded, but flattened, and it
expands to reveal one continuous strip of paper which stands upright as
a cube without top or bottom. On the outside are drawings, in deep black
ink, of figures engaged in various activities: men in flowing tunics
reclined on couches, drinking from large vessels; women and nymphs and
satyrs dancing and playing pipes and timbrels; youths leaning into a
kiss amongst trees while birds perch on the branches above; a calf
adorned with garlands and fabrics and jewelry, led by a procession of
figures in elaborate dress. The inside is a continuous drawing of ships
at sea, above which are words.</span> Do you like my paper urn? You
should write an ode to it.</p>
<p><span class="ed">On the left, the writing is neat cursive, in black
ink.</span></p>
<p>Dear Eden,</p>
<p>Why must you send me such beautiful things that I have to destroy to
open?</p>
<p>I did not realize a postcard—the card itself, not its sender—could
exhibit visible distress. In these letters to me you have accomplished
things I never thought possible. I try to do the same, but my craft is
words, not paper. So why do I have none for you? I’m supposed to know
what to say and how to say it. But I only have sights and sounds and
sensations. Your moth dress. A dirty tennis ball. “Kids In America” with
the windows down. Your voice. The water of the pool at night. The dry
hug of the towel. The force of your hands the first time you touched me,
shoving me.</p>
<p><span class="ed">At this point, nearing the bottom of the card, the
lines become squatter and there is less and less space between them,
until they become illegible, like a sea of blue ink. But pulling on the
bottom of the card, with a firm hold on the top, reveals it is stretchy;
the paper grows and the words take their proper dimension, become
readable.</span></p>
<p>But every time you send me things, I’m speechless. “I don’t think I
can follow that,” say the poets who speak at the open mics I attend,
when they have the misfortune of going after a particularly good
performance.</p>
<p>The longer it goes I don’t respond, the greater grows my fear I will
stop hearing from you. And the world–</p>
<p><span class="ed">Pulling and pulling like taffy, and more words
appear.</span></p>
<p>–gets darker, and I can’t see the meaning in things, the secret
messages that tell me the direction of Right and Wrong. I become Ego
Soul, impotent executor of individual will. . . .</p>
<p>I bought a 50 pack of envelopes. Perhaps if I send them all to you,
it will atone for my tardiness. . . .</p>
<p>I am three letters behind on you—not to mention the ones that were
lost. But all that I receive, I give back, not reflected but
transformed, filtered through me, through my capacities and
incapacities. The volleys shall be returned in kind. I live a
constrained life, free of Valhallan hubris. The contract must be
fulfilled. . . .</p>
<p><span class="ed">The paper hangs flaccid, long and wrinkled with
stretch marks. A weak pull causes it to distend further.</span></p>
<p>. . . I have your actual cards here with me. They are limited in that
way, since they really exist. But I sent you nothing, so I can say I
created anything. My letters obey no physical law, require no postage,
they can be as heavy as a ship, as large as a library, as elaborate as a
maze, as perfect as gospel. For this they pay a dear price, that being
nonexistence. I am a great artist but only in ecphrasis.</p>
<p>–Ecphras</p>
<p><span class="ed">Finally, the card goes taut again, stretched to its
maximum tension, gone inelastic. The message has ended and cannot be
formed back into its original shape. On the right, below the address
space, the stretched paper has revealed a previously hidden flap taped
onto the empty white of the card. Lifting the flap reveals a final
message.</span></p>
<p>I hold on tight.</p>
<p>Bacon bits on my lentils. I love it. Good idea about the ham.</p>
<p>Your card reminds me of medievial paintings in tempera.</p>
<p>Butter comes in rectangles.</p>
<p>Thinking about rhythms and dance. The artistry of conversation,
attention, verbal, physical. I hope you’re having great sex.</p>
<p>You can call me Gig. You have no names, I have many.</p>
<p>Eagerly awaiting your next volley.</p>
<p><span class="ed">Turning over the card which has become a long
scroll, the eye on the front has grown into a surreal scene when
arranged lengthwise. Included in the panorama are various shapes and
symbols, a flowering linseed, an orange tree, and a nighttime cityscape,
tall, darkly silhouetted buildings with glowing lighted windows, the
scene bisected by a blue river, across which is a bridge hosting a pair
of trains speeding along in opposite directions.</span></p>
