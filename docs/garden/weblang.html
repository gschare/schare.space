On the Virtue of Boilerplate in Web Languages
</title>
<h1 id="on-the-virtue-of-boilerplate-in-web-languages">On The Virtue of
Boilerplate in Web Languages</h1>
<span id="date"><em>Jul 10, 2024</em></span>
<p>
</p>
<hr>
<p>HTML + CSS + JavaScript rendered in the browser is by far the best UI
infrastructure <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It runs on every machine through a
browser. There are countless resources available online to answer any
question you have about programming UI for the web. LLMs can write the
entire thing for you. It has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy7uMpPrGMA">never been a better
time</a> to <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">write tiny
personal apps</a> that leverage the web as an interface.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs just one problem: what if you want persistent data? Unless
you‚Äôre comfortable sticking with local browser storage (I‚Äôm not), you
will need a database and a backend. To access a database in the browser,
your client must communicate with a web server. And servers are
complicated <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="case-study">Case study</h2>
<p>I was interested in writing a simple application for tracking my
finances. I figured it would be easiest to write a terminal-based UI so
that I would avoid all that nasty server business. I would run a program
from the terminal, as god intended! I tried writing my app using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html">curses</a> library
in Python, but I quickly became frustrated when I had to write a
selector dropdown by hand using the low-level rendering interface of
curses. I realized I was not interested in reinventing the wheel here.
All my interface needs were solved problems. <a href="https://select2.org/">Select2</a>‚Äôs richness taunted me in my
lowly text-based interface.</p>
<p>Knowing I wanted to use HTML for my frontend and that this required a
server, I started thinking about all the web stacks I could use <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. While Python with Flask or Django
would certainly be the most practical, I decided to treat this as a
practical exercise for learning a new language and its web stack. I
considered TypeScript, Elixir, Elm, ReasonML, even Racket, Haskell, and
Rust. TypeScript felt too mainstream and I have a strong aversion to
Node; Elixir too corporate (the books aren‚Äôt free!); Elm and ReasonML
too frontend; Racket, Haskell, and Rust not optimized for the web. I
heard about <a href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a> a few weeks ago. It
is simple, modern, with a great package manager and an active and
friendly community. I downloaded the language and followed a <a href="https://gleaming.dev/articles/building-your-first-gleam-web-app/">short
tutorial</a> on building web apps using Gleam‚Äôs web frameworks Wisp and
Lustre for back-end and front-end respectively, and Mist for the web
server. Here‚Äôs what I gleaned.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-a-web-app">The structure of a web app</h2>
<p>When writing a web application, one can use a familiar structure <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A directory containing databases;</li>
<li>A directory containing front-end assets like CSS and
JavaScript;</li>
<li>A main entrypoint module that initializes the web server and passes
all requests to the router;</li>
<li>A module containing the boilerplate for processing a request,
preparing a response, and setting up the internal state of the
server;</li>
<li>A router module that uses the request handler to process the route
and dispatch to various functions for performing server-side
computations and generating HTML pages in response;</li>
<li>A module or set of modules for the layout and rendering of the
pages;</li>
<li>A module containing models of the application data and server-side
transformations thereof;</li>
<li>A module containing the server-side computations, database queries,
etc. that are called by the router.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is pretty complicated! Note that almost all of it is essentially
reusable boilerplate. I‚Äôm sure that very large, complex, and optimized
web applications must be written bespoke for performance reasons. But
for a simple web application as most people are creating, this is far
too high a barrier to using the browser as a rendering engine. Remember
that the alternative is writing programs that run entirely in the
terminal and print text to the screen‚Äîthe leap from that to using HTML
is far too great. I believe most of this complexity can be hidden from
the application developer. And if the developer wants to tweak some of
the request handler middleware (how the request is processed), a simple
configuration file will do.</p>
<p>If we cut away all of the code that is only there to set up the
server, we are left with a reasonably-sized chunk of core application
logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Front-end assets</li>
<li>Router</li>
<li>Layout/rendering</li>
<li>Data model</li>
<li>Server-side computations</li>
</ul>
<p>In my dream language, a web app would look something like this:</p>

<p>This looks a little barebones. In particular, there‚Äôs no explicit
database connection or application state (though we don‚Äôt use the latter
in this example). I imagine there are monads threading everything
(database connections, application state, etc.). That <code>serve</code>
function initializes a monad using the data in <code>cfg</code> and then
passes that to <code>router</code>, which is monadic. I am eliding
function signatures here, but this is a language with strong static
types.</p>
<p>Would it surprise you to hear that this language exists and I use it
in my day job?</p>
<h2 id="introducing-urweb">Introducing Ur/Web</h2>
<p>Okay, it‚Äôs not <em>quite</em> what I described above. Ur/Web is
slightly more opinionated than my language, and my syntax is quite
fanciful and probably unparseable. But Ur/Web agrees on the key
points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static types</li>
<li>Functional paradigm</li>
<li>Embedded SQL and HTML with static types checking
well-formedness</li>
<li>Syntax for defining tables</li>
<li>Designed specifically for the web</li>
</ul>
<p>Ur/Web assumes that the functions in your main module correspond to
endpoints and automatically launches an Apache server for your
application. This is a bit archaic. I think we should specify the
endpoints explicitly, and while we‚Äôre at it, we might as well require
the user put one line of boilerplate to initialize the server using a
library function.</p>
<p>The canonical way to define dynamic behavior in Ur/Web revolves
around these endpoints: each function corresponds to a URL and its
arguments are serialized and passed in the URL as parameters. This is
fairly reasonable, but I don‚Äôt love it. While Ur/Web has ways around
this, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great default. User interaction‚Äîparticularly
interacting with a database behind the scenes‚Äîshould be live and
reactive by default. React and other frameworks have popularized this
idea. Redirecting the user to a new URL and back every time they query
the server is pretty cumbersome. In fact, Ur/Web prefers this model too
with its <code>source</code> and <code>signal</code> monads and its
<code>dyn</code> and <code>active</code> code blocks in HTML. In my
imagined language, reactivity is confidently the default: dynamic
components on pages may make remote procedure calls to update data
sources, at which point backend listeners automatically re-render the
relevant UI whether or not the DOM element which initiated the update is
the same as the one receiving it.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-urweb">Why Not Ur/Web</h2>
<p>If Ur/Web is so great, why doesn‚Äôt everyone use it? There‚Äôs a handful
of reasons:</p>
<div class="nobullet">
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Popularity.</strong> Ur/Web is Adam Chlipala‚Äôs brainchild
and it has not enjoyed the marketing and engineering resources that
major languages depend on to thrive. Language popularity is a virtuous
cycle: languages that people use get more resources devoted to
developing and popularizing them. Ur/Web has not entered this positive
feedback loop, and so it hangs in obscurity and it lags at the pace of
development resultant of a few engineers devoting a small amount of
their time to it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Libraries.</strong> Ur/Web is under development. Its
libraries are not yet stable and it is missing a lot of essential
libraries that make a well-rounded programming language. Also, due to
the aforementioned popularity problem, practically nobody is developing
new libraries for Ur/Web <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overly advanced type system.</strong> Part of the reason
I chose Gleam for my little web app case study is its simple but
functional type system. Ur/Web, on the other hand, is an academic
language with a really cool type system that also happens to be
incredibly difficult to use. Also, like other statically typed
functional languages, most of the errors you get in Ur/Web are compiler
type-checking errors; unlike other languages, its error messages are
obscure <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paradigm.</strong> Functional languages are becoming
increasingly mainstream, but Ur/Web‚Äôs corner of advanced ML-style static
functional programming with row types is quite an obscure niche within
FP. Adopters are unlikely to be familiar with many of Ur/Web‚Äôs core
concepts unless they are experienced OCaml programmers or have a PhD in
programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outdated architecture.</strong> Ur/Web has a strong
opinion about the architecture of web apps, and this design has become
obsolete relative to the fast pace of web dev state of the art. For
example, Ur/Web elides the frontend/backend distinction and instead
defers to the compiler to decide what gets run where. On a team split
into backend and frontend programmers, this obviously will not fly. The
language‚Äôs SQL embedding, server setup, and the aforementioned routing
are elements of its larger philosophy. If you disagree with this
philosophy or find your application going in a different direction,
Ur/Web is difficult to justify. The boilerplate of languages less
optimized for the web is tolerable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="the-cost-of-boilerplate">The Cost of Boilerplate</h2>
<p>We can roughly divide the pieces required to implement that Gleam web
app into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One-off server setup boilerplate</li>
<li>Backend &amp; frontend logic</li>
<li>Boilerplate necessary for each additional page, feature, model,
etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 can be hidden or explicit as a matter of taste. #2 is necessary.
#3 is what bothers me.</p>
<p>Whenever we add an additional page with a new data type or table
underlying it, we have to touch every layer of abstraction from the
route parsing to the data encoding and decoding. Ur/Web removes the need
for this, since routes are implicit in function and module names and SQL
schemas live in the program rather than outside it; you can write this
behavior declaratively and the compiler handles the details.
Furthermore, the frontend data model never disagrees with the backend
because they share the same types <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I suggest that much of the apparent complexity of web apps comes from
#3. A different approach‚Äîlike the more principled approach of
Ur/Web‚Äîavoids it entirely at the cost of flexibility.</p>
<p>But what is the cost of this boilerplate? Actually very little. The
one-off server setup is a constant complexity burden on the program,
while the data marshalling and other busy work of adding new features
carries linear complexity. Neither of these are very bad <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="web-stack-of-dreams">Web Stack of Dreams</h2>
<p>I must backpedal on my indictment of Ur/Web for fear that Adam will
read this and think me unhappy. In fact, I called Ur/Web‚Äôs approach
<em>principled</em>. This is not a compliment but a descriptor.
Principled is exactly what HTML + CSS + JavaScript are not. Ur/Web is
out of place among the web languages. Yet it represents a noble vision
and perhaps a necessary one. Ur/Web insists that sense can be made of
the web stack. It is a kind of beacon or prophecy for what a future
full-stack web DSL might look like: a harmony of database, frontend, and
backend code, with all the nasty server stuff hidden away in the
runtime.</p>
<p>Ur/Web‚Äôs philosophy ironically has the potential to be a very
accessible way to write web apps for new programmers. By eliding much of
the boilerplate that might confuse a newcomer and instead focusing on
the core logic, Ur/Web could be a triumph in this niche if not for its
experts-only type system.</p>
<p>For now, we trudge along with the unprincipled but practical
technologies for web development. Perhaps‚Äîdare I dream‚ÄîUr/Web will
influence the next generation of web stacks.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>You may disagree on the fine points.
For instance, HTML + CSS + JavaScript is a very tolerant and flexible
system because it has to work well enough on all browsers on all systems
since the web was invented. HTML doesn‚Äôt have to be well-formed like
XML. JavaScript is dynamic and has all kind of <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">weird behavior</a>
by design. It is reasonable to critique this system, but only if you are
honest about its intended use cases. If you are developing a big,

<a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">ReasonML</a>, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, and probably a whole bunch of
other popular ones I haven‚Äôt heard of because they‚Äôre imperative and I
typically prefer functional. You can use the flexible interface of the
web but perform static checking and avoid most of the common
frustrations of the frontend stack.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>Even totally local web apps are
complicated! Browser security limits the user‚Äôs ability to interact with
the world outside the browser except through secure protocols like
HTTPS. This means no dynamic pages loading data from the local
filesystem. It is technically possible to write a fully local web
app‚Äîi.e., frontend only‚Äîwith a database by <a href="https://cristobal.space/writing/folk.html">dropping the database
file in through a form or event listener</a> and querying it with
something like <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">sql.js</a>‚Ä¶
but my contention is that writing server-backed apps should be easier
and more accessible.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>At this time I should note that I‚Äôm
technically a professional web developer. I use <a href="http://www.impredicative.com/ur/">Ur/Web</a> at my job. More on
that later. I am not very familiar with the normie web stacks like
full-stack JavaScript of TypeScript using frameworks like React, let
alone any of the object-oriented stacks. I‚Äôve messed around with Flask
and Django before, but I never got into it, and while I spent a summer
learning React, I do not remember any of it. Truth be told, my
experience with web servers is a programming assignment from sophomore
year where we had to write a toy web server from scratch in C using the
Unix sockets API. A great test of C skills to be sure, but not a good
way to quickly build basic web applications. So yeah, this is my first
time writing a web app for realsies. But how can I be a backend web
developer if I don‚Äôt know how servers work? You will see.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>Big disclaimer: I am learning this
for the first time. To my understanding, there are many diverse ways to
structure web applications, and for each one there are countless
frameworks that provide diverse interfaces to such a system. Here, for
most of the points in this article, I am considering a web app that uses
minimal frameworks for frontend and backend and writes the routing logic
manually, making use of libraries for stuff like request parsing and the
actual server code.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5" role="doc-endnote"><p>Except <a href="https://nectry.com/">me and a handful of my friends</a>.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6" role="doc-endnote"><p>And I say that as someone who is
comfortable with Haskell and OCaml type errors! The situation must be
dire indeed!<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7" role="doc-endnote"><p>Happily, Gleam and other full-stack
languages that compile to JavaScript share this property. TypeScript is
especially similar to Ur/Web in this sense, especially when used with
frameworks like React.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8" role="doc-endnote"><p>At least we don‚Äôt have a quadratic
burden where each new component needs to define its relationship to each
other one! I cannot think of a case where that might happen in web apps.
Perhaps they are simple by nature. Or perhaps decades of web development
have discovered the best practices for how to structure web apps in a
relatively hygienic fashion. Either way, I learned this structure for
the first time yesterday by reading the tutorial and it did not take
long to understand and appreciate.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
