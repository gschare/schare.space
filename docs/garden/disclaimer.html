    <h1>Disclaimer on Gardening</h1>

    <div>
        <p>I have never gardened in my life. But I have always gardened
        digitally.</p>

        <p>I love using physical notebooks for lectures, sketches, scratch
        work, and anytime using a computer would be inappropriate. By default,
        I work digitally. My electronic notes are one part of a
        highly-organized and bespoke (read: idiosyncratic) system of hypermedia
        and software that functions as my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think"> extended
            memory</a>.  The public part of this system is the garden.</p>

        <p> Perhaps I should not call it a garden, because I have not earned
        the metaphor. "Wiki" is an alternative, but brings with it rigid
        notions about the form and process. Since I've heard of relatively few
        people talking about digital gardens, the term functions to impede the
        visitor's preconceptions and leave them open to the reception of a new
        form.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, the emphasis in digital gardening is not on the end
        product, but <a href="cultivation.html">process</a>. (I assume that
        this is also the case with real gardening for many hobbyists.) The term
        "wiki" lacks an obvious single verb to describe the whole process.
        Wikifying? You see the problem. It is easier to simply call it
        gardening. Plus, it gives me a convenient term to help articulate the
        activity of leisurely maintenance of virtual spaces and tinkering with
        personal software that I have been doing as long as I can remember.</p>

        <p>I hope that the garden metaphor does not disappoint when you
        discover there are no leaves and flowers, no watering can or bees
        buzzing around. While I could artifically insert the sounds of the wind
        and insects and the imagery of vegetation through the HTML of this
        website, it would implicitly undermine the strength of the metaphor. I
        believe this really is already a garden in the ways that matter: it is
        deliberate, it is homegrown, it is constantly changing, and it is
        peaceful.
