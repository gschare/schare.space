<p><span class="warning">Spoilers!</span></p>
<p>I‚Äôm rewatch-pilled now. I saw <em>Ran</em> twice in two days. Did the
same with <em>Mickey 17</em>. You catch so many details, develop an
appreciation even for a film you weren‚Äôt initially so thrilled
about.</p>
<p>Between this and Severance, the problem of personal identity is in
the zeitgeist. The people demand to know: is there such a thing as a
soul that contains our personality, or can personhood be reduced to
observable components? Mickey 17, to my delight, has an opinion about
this. Yes, says Bong Joon Ho, there is a soul. Immortal soul: body dies,
it lives on, finds its body again. Not just memories: two prints of the
same matter, same memories, but different: the second one is not
ensouled. Old body still kicking around, body and soul bound together,
no free soul to inhabit the new body. So God gives each human one soul,
only one, eternal monad. Eternal life is Christian, but clones are a
no-no.</p>
<p>Does it shatter my theory to admit it is the bad guy who declares
this?</p>
<p>Mickey 18, without a soul, is a psychopath. Consider the only other
multiples in the film, the mad scientist/serial killer, an echo with
Cronenberg‚Äôs <em>Dead Ringers</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps another set of multiples: Kenneth and Ylfa Marshall, who
maybe kept illegal ‚Äúbackups‚Äù using the printing technology. To be
honest, I was confused by that scene at the end.</p>
<p>Mickey 18 may not have a soul. Is he human? As long as he fears
death‚Äîthe survival instinct is the criterion of life. Again, it is the
bad guy who says this.</p>
<p>Does the soul have memory? I‚Äôve long felt that the soul is, to
analogize, to human memory as RAM is to disk. The data is nothing if you
don‚Äôt have a running process containing the computation. (Hence, we will
only crack human intelligence when we stop thinking in Von Neumann and
start thinking in LISP, with continuations!)</p>
<p>Everyone wants to know what it‚Äôs like to die. The question is never
answered. It‚Äôs the wrong question.</p>
<p>Kai and Jennifer are eager bug-killers, <em>Starship Troopers</em>.
Also elements from Miyazaki‚Äôs <em>Nausicaa of the Valley of the
Wind</em>, adapted here more as story template than as allusion.
<em>Mickey 17</em> thematically overlaps but little more. And, of
course, the obvious similarities to <em>Wall-E</em>, <em>Don‚Äôt Look
Up</em>, <em>Prey</em> (2017 video game), <em>Avenue 5</em>. What
else?</p>
<p>Structurally fun for the first half. Nod at the classic,
freeze-frame, ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôre wondering how I ended up here,‚Äù extended
flashback, catch us up to present. Comes back at the end. C.f. media
with VO throughout, e.g.¬†<em>Wolf of Wall Street</em>,
<em>Euphoria</em>.</p>
<p>Good technique here, must steal. Examples:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A nice mirror shot between Mickey waking up in the printer and
waking up pulled by the mama creeper. Got to appreciate the little
things like this, how skilled filmmakers take every opportunity‚Äîevery
shot, every movement‚Äîto strengthen the storytelling. Even if only to
say: he is still alive.</p></li>
<li><p>No need to portray the actual first conversation between Mickey
and Nasha. We get it from the body language, gestures, music. I‚Äôd be
hard-pressed to recount a specific exchange from my own life, especially
conversations that feature flirtatious banter, speed and wit,
short-lived in-jokes, impossible to convey. It is more intellectually
honest to elide the details!</p></li>
<li><p>Subtle thing in the exposition: Mickey signs up to be an
Expendable, the clerk confirms he has read the paperwork (are you sure
you want to sign up for this?). This could easily come <em>before</em>
the audience knows the term Expendable. I wonder if it moved around in
the edit. As it appears in the film, the point of this little scene is
not that printing sucks (we know that already), but that Mickey is both
desperate and stupid, vulnerable, might have regrets, as the VO
emphasizes for those not paying attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Permit yourself to create simple contrivances to move the plot
forward. Ylfa needs to make that sauce <em>right now</em>! Or another
little visual contrivance: put the <em>Arrival</em>-esque scientist
behind Mickey while he speaks to the creeper, she‚Äôs underneath a
decontamination spray that goes off, and rack focus for good measure, to
draw attention to her, to ensure the audience knows she saw Mickey
communicating with the alien/rightful native inhabitant.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sex positions are a major plot point, but notice the futuristic iPad
on which these animated drawings are made. We have no reason to believe
the loser Mickey Barnes is an amateur animator. Must be a dream
application: draw on a tablet with a stylus, building in animation
without switching modes. Some kind of Bret Victor user interface utopia
within this cyberpunk dystopia.</p>
<p>Cool trailer.</p>
