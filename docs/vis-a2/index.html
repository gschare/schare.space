<h2>Transit-Oriented Development</h2>
<p>I chose the <a href="https://vis-society.github.io/theme/transportation.html">transit-oriented
development (TOD) theme</a>.</p>
<p>Transit-oriented development (TOD) is the strategy of building
higher-density housing and mixed-use developments centered around
transit stations in order to foster good quality of living: access to
jobs, education, housing, and services, all without requiring urban
residents to own a car. TOD argues that, just as shops tend to cluster
in town centers and jobs in commercial districts, compact housing should
cluster around transit stations to provide mobility options to as many
people as possible and stimulate the economy of the area and neighboring
communities. Its skeptics tend to be concerned about the effect of
upzoning and increased density on the character of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The difficulties of TOD include coordinating different stakeholders
(including local government, real estate developers, residents, business
owners, and transit agencies), strategically choosing locations for
targeted development, and obtaining funding for these necessarily large,
complex, and expensive projects. The method is becoming increasingly
popular. I had the chance to FaceTime with Redmond Councilmember Vivek
Prakriya—the youngest councilmember in the US—who just helped pass a
transit-oriented development plan sponsored by major tech companies.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, the MBTA Communities Act requires all Metro Boston
municipalities served by the MBTA to upzone single-family housing to
allow multifamily housing near some rail rapid transit stations. <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/03/22/mbta-communities-zoning-overstated-impact-luc-schuster">Critics
have pointed out</a> that the law may be less effective than intended.
Some municipalities were non-compliant, which led to tensions and
lawsuits between the city and state governments.</p>
</section>
<section id="questions" class="level2">
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>What are the demographics of the towns and cities in Greater Boston
that resisted the MBTA Communities Act? Do they lean wealthier and
whiter and with more single-family zoning?</li>
<li>Where are the areas of highest potential for TOD according to the 3
Vs: node value, place value, and market potential value? In particular,
where is there a high disparity between existing transit connections and
economic value?</li>
<li>How many rail stops are there are in each municipality? What does
this correlate with?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="dataset" class="level2">
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>We have three datasets have available to help answer these
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Census</li>
<li>MBTA (stops and lines)</li>
<li>Redlining</li>
</ul>
<p>The zoning and census data comes from MAPC’s Zoning Atlas. It covers
101 Metro Boston municipalities; for each one it gives the percentage of
residential land zoned exclusively for single-family housing, whether it
is an MBTA Community, census data from the 2010 Decennial US Census,
including population, distribution of age brackets and race/ethnicity
categories, and income bracket census data from the 2014–2018 American
Community Survey.</p>
<p>We also have municipal boundaries from MassGIS, which will help
relate the census data to the MBTA data.</p>
<p>The transit dataset includes stops and lines derived from MBTA’s GTFS
feed, converted to GeoJSON and processed to remove duplicates.</p>
<p>The redlining dataset contains spatial data labeling areas according
to the 1935-1940 HOLC City Survey Files (from the National Archives).
These historical grades were used by real estate professionals to assess
lending risk and are infamously racist. The data is from the Mapping
Inequality project at the University of Richmond. We can use this to
compare with current transit and zoning.</p>
</section>
<section id="exploration" class="level2">
<h2>Exploration</h2>
<p>Before approaching the questions, I played around in Tableau to do
some sense-making of the data.</p>
<p>The most obvious initial thing to do, for me, was to use the GeoJSON
data to plot the municipalities and make sure they appeared correctly.
Then I superimposed the routes and stops. The result is busy, but mostly
matches what I’d expect.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tableau/geo.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The one surprise is that many cities far away from Boston have no
single-family-only zoning. My assumption (based on intuition that Boston
is surrounded mostly by suburbs made up predominantly of single-family
homes) is that they are in practice still mostly single-family housing,
but with no areas <em>solely</em> zoned for that. It is also possible
that the entire municipality has been upzoned but existing houses remain
in place. Without more data we cannot say for certain, so I’ll let this
question rest.</p>
<p>The next thing I thought to do is relate the municipality data to the
MBTA stops data and count how many stops there are per municipality.</p>
<p>As expected, the distribution is dramatic.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tableau/stops_by_muni.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we map it using the spatial data we can see how the transit stop
density decreases radially outward from Boston, the transit hub.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tableau/stops_by_muni_geo.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An interesting aspect of visualization psychology emerges here. The
bar chart I just showed follows an exponential curve, but it is quite
readable so there is no reason to use a logarithmic scale. When mapping
the same measure onto color, however, it is much harder to tell the
relative difference. For that reason I experimented with with mapping
the logarithm of the number of stops onto the same color scale.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tableau/stops_by_muni_log_geo.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I decided to create a small multiples chart to get a sense of how
transit stop density correlates with population.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tableau/stops_by_pop.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This alerted me to the first and only problem I encountered with data
quality. The population is wrong! Salem doesn’t have more people than
Boston! At first I wondered if this was just how censuses work—maybe
they take a representative sample instead of the actual population
count—but after reviewing the metadata, the source of the data on the US
Decennial Census, and searching the internet, I learned that this was
definitely a mistake in the data. Then I called my friend who confirmed
it was not just me, and that the TAs are aware. (Sometimes
sanity-checking data means asking another human.)</p>
<p>So while we can’t rely on using population directly, we might be able
to <em>treat it</em> (for the purposes of the assignment) as a
representative sample, if we can confirm that the proportions are
realistic. We can assess the distribution of income, race, and sex and
compare them to common sense.</p>
<p>The income data comes in brackets, which makes it slightly awkward to
work with in Tableau. I made a pivot table along the income bracket
fields and then used that to create a stacked bar chart displaying the
(binned) distributions for each municipality.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/tableau/income_stacked.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a fairly reasonable distribution, with some municipalities
having very extreme distributions. A quick look confirms basic common
sense: Cambridge is wealthier than Boston, Winthrop is very poor, Dover
is very rich. No surprises here.</p>
<p>When I tried to do the same pivot for race and sex categories,
Tableau became unresponsive. After many attempts to fix it, I gave up.
This was the straw that broke my back in terms of frustrations with
Tableau. While the interaction experience was positive and productive
for exploration, the software was sluggish and crashed so frequently as
to be unusable.</p>
<p>In order to proceed I switched to Python, heavily assisted by Cursor.
My workflow involved iteratively looking at the visualizations it
created and instructing the agent what changes to make or which new
visualizations to generate, asking questions about data transformations,
and inspecting the analysis code to make tweaks as necessary.</p>
<p>With this new workflow I could return to the question of the
sensibility of the proportionality of the demographic data.</p>
<p>I visualized the racial/ethnic breakdown of the population by
municipality with another stacked bar chart. (Note that this is a slice
of the top 35 by population, so it does not include all municipalities.
This was to avoid taking up too much space or making the chart too dense
like it was in the Tableau visualizations.)</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/zoning_population_by_ethnicity.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This seems basically plausible, just like the income. We can finish
this investigation by looking at the sex ratio, which should be
basically balanced.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/zoning_population_by_gender.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fun fact: Salem does indeed have a significant difference between
male and female populations.</p>
<p>I believe this settles the question: we can use the demographic data
as long as we do it proportionally by municipality instead of
absolutely. Note that I would definitely not proceed with this clearly
incorrect data in a real-world analysis.</p>
</section>
<section id="investigation" class="level2">
<h2>Investigation</h2>
<p>Having gotten a sense of the data I found that some of my questions
were intractable because of the lack of relevant data in the
datasets.</p>
<p>The datasets have no info about implementation or response to the
MBTA Communities act, so we cannot answer the first question directly.
Instead we can look at which municipalities are “MBTA Communities” and
get a sense of how Metro Boston would be impacted by the policy.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/mbta_communities.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>MBTA Communities notably do not include Boston; the purpose of the
designation is to encourage development in areas that are served by the
MBTA but less dense and less well-connected than cities closer to the
metropolitan center. The other non-MBTA communities are Bolton, Hudson,
and Milford—all municipalities not connected to the MBTA, with small
populations. This insight is important in a non-flashy way. We don’t
have a very interesting visualization to show for it—unless we follow
the Don Norman approach and consider a simple list a powerful
representation. Consider this an “anti-visualization.”</p>

<p>As for the second question, these datasets have no very good proxy
for place value or market potential value that we can use in identifying
areas of high potential for transit-oriented development. Ideally we
would rely on economic activity indicators (e.g. business density, job
growth, granular population maps, historical trends, and of course
housing density) and detailed transit data (route ridership, node
connections) and assess how those correlate with each other. Then we
would then generate visualizations identifying which areas display high
disparity between the variables, and recommend further investigation
into building transits nodes there. But the data is not available, and
the granularity—municipalities, rather than neighborhoods or blocks—is
too coarse to carry out precise analysis of station area value.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I can gesture at the type of analysis we might perform
by using income data at the municipal scale, compared against MBTA maps
and zoning data, to make some very tentative claims about which cities
would benefit from transit-oriented development.</p>
<p>Basically the hypothesis goes that areas mostly zoned for
single-family housing only but which have a high number of existing
transit connections are likely to benefit from transit-oriented
development.</p>
<p>We can also look into how those variables correlate with income and
race.</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>Given that one of my questions became intractable, I’ll throw you one
more fun piece of data investigation: how do the inner core cities
(Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, Somerville) compare to the rest of Metro
Boston?</p>
<p>First, let us look within the inner core cities themselves.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/explore_inner_core_indicators.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This accords with intuition. However, it is hard to tell which cities
are most dense because Boston is so much larger than the other inner
core cities. We can use the spatial data to normalize over the area.</p>
<figure>
<img src="img/explore_inner_core_rail_stops_per_area.png" alt="">
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now with a good sense of the inner core cities, let us compare to the
rest of Metro Boston.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The data on transit-oriented development cannot address other
concerns I have about the topic, such as the fact that the buildings
erected are often 5-over-1s and supremely ugly. (I simply do not wish
for the new face of dynamic transit-oriented American cities to look
identical to Graduate Junction.)</p>
<p>I am strongly in favor of transit-oriented development. At various
junctures in my life I opted to live in walkable cities instead of the
alternative. Where I live now I am a few minutes walk from major bus
lines and a 15 minute walk from a major subway station. When I lived in
Brooklyn, I was a 2 minute walk from a major subway station. The
difference between those experiences is dramatic, but nothing compared
to the experience of not having reasonable access to transit. Where I
grew up in the suburbs, the nearest bus stop was a 30 minute walk away.
I never once rode the bus until New Year’s Eve a couple of months ago,
when the transit authority subsidized it with free service to discourage
drunk driving. With total sincerity I can say that this assignment gave
me an appreciation for the work that data analysts and transportation
researchers do in helping build more livable, more equitable, more
sustainable, and more vibrant cities.</p>
