            <p>
                A <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital garden</a>
                is loaded metaphor. It evokes a "gardener" who spends their
                leisure time tending to their digital spaces by maintaining and
                updating personal websites, notes, projects, ....
            </p>

            <p> In another sense, the "garden" itself is a public digital space
            where visitors can wander through a hypermedia graph without a
            specific goal or designated "correct" path. Visitors can relax and
            breathe deeply, because this is not a space that expects anything
            of you. The seeds in the garden are simply there so that others can
            watch them grow.  </p>

            <p> It is <i>not</i> a blog, portfolio, book, catalogue, or archive
            (though I do like those things).  It <i>is</i> a celebration and
            appreciation of virtual space.  </p>

            <p>If anything, it is most similar to a wiki.
            Hypertext is central to my conception of the digital
            garden.</p>

            <p> My garden is eclectic. You may find experiments, half-finished
            ideas, and poetry. You may find dead-ends and loops. You may
            find context or you may not. You may come back another day and
            find things have shifted, appeared, or disappeared. </p>
