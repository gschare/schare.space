<h1>Reprogram: a malleability manifesto</h1>
<p>Adam Smith began <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> with the observation
that workers specialized in a kind of labor naturally invent
improvements to their method on the job. He relates the story of a boy
who, having been made to work in a factory and deprived of playtime with
his fellows, finds he can automate the action of the pistons with a
rubber band, freeing him to divert himself. The effect is easy to
observe in the case of physical machinery—single objects to which a
worker’s mind may be directed for the majority of their labor time—but
the phenomenon extends broadly; laborers engaged in practically any work
are particularly well-situated to become experts in the technology they
use daily, qualified to invent improvements.</p>
<p>Today’s software is not so malleable. It resists change, stifling
technological progress. Contrary to what you might intuit about the
experience of operating a <em>reprogrammable</em> machine, workers
trained in using software invent no meaningful improvements. In
contemporary computer science we often discuss programs, more rarely
discuss programming, and seldom mention reprogramming. Just as the
“engagement”-driven design of software and social media reduce creative
and social activity to mere passive consumption, workers made to use
software systems find their natural inclination toward autonomous
invention reduced to mere helpless suggestion. One can just picture that
same boy, supposing he was born 250 years later and works retail now at
a Target, conceiving of an improvement to the cash register system,
perhaps even getting the approval of his boss, but the change is
rejected. The company that develops the software refuses to update it,
citing “complexity” and equivocating about how that is “not the
direction they are taking the product.” We would like such a story, but
in fact the situation is more dire and precludes this romantic view. The
boy does not invent an improvement, because the software, an intangible
and opaque object exposing a limited surface of programmed interactions,
can not be altered in any way. Really he does not even <em>imagine</em>
an improvement, because, subjected to operating this alien machine that
constrains freedom of use by its very structure, the boy’s natural
creative spirit is deadened—“overprogrammed.” There is no boy inventor.
There is hardly even a boy worker. There is instead a boy user.</p>
<p>The situation is at the same time more optimistic. Indeed it would
not be possible to begin to form a critique of modern software, if,
through the cracks in alienating software, we did not observe workers
developing, against all odds, solutions of their own design, tacit
knowledge and folk practices shared in local contexts, overlooked due
what Lucy Suchman in <em>Human-Machine Reconfigurations</em> calls the
machine’s “obliviousness.” It is by studying the actual experiences of
users of workplace software that we can develop an understanding of the
precise properties, together constituting this quality we call
“malleability,” of software tools that enable workers to autonomously
improve their technology.</p>
<div class="comment">
<p>As opposed to just naively building yet another alienated solution. I
want to actually go and do the research, see how they operate, and use
that to inspire and refine our ideas about malleable design. The point
of this research is to understand malleability by engaging with folk
practices across multiple different domains. It has to be different
domains or else it wouldn’t generalize to a broadly useful theory of
software design.</p>
</div>
<p>Further, by studying users of consumer software we can broaden the
scope of our research on digital alienation and inflexible tools to
include all aspects of modern life, not just professional labor.
Investigating the frustrations experienced by users of creative,
entertainment, professional, and bureaucratic software, I expect we will
encounter <em>designed</em> obstacles: systems of control dangerously
inhibiting our basic creativity, obsessed with security yet insensitive
to the necessity of autonomous usage, the necessity of play. By casting
off the yoke of “user,” we can change our programming, reveal and enjoy
the fundamental malleability in our digital environments, and reclaim
the term “engagement” from the vocabularies of control to refer instead
to a form of tool use characterized by free, voluntary, self-directed
action.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Aside: when I see people using AI to easily and swiftly achieve
things that before would require a lot of work requiring skill in
specialized tools to accomplish, I feel uncomfortable. It’s obviously
good, a step towards this vision of malleability, but at the same time
it continues some of the trends I’m complaining about here. AI tools
still treat us as the user, not a capable <em>homo habilis</em>
reshaping our malleable world. I think this is because one property of
malleable tools is interpretable structure, which AI doesn’t have by
default—the structural levers need to be intentionally designed through
meditation on the “language” of the domain. Plus, the whole thing is
quite inelegant and, to me, unintuitive. I’ve always been someone
obsessed with careful detail and understanding the entire process.</p>
<p>On overprogramming: Ivan Illich claims that this deadening of
creative spirit is due to using tools that are so highly specialized
they require professional training to use, restricting their usage and
preventing one man from using many different tools, and they deprive man
of freedom, creativity, and agency because they engender a society in
which man is used to receiving programmed training. I believe this
places the blame on specialized tools and conformist education, when in
fact it is precisely the specialization that allows the worker to become
intimate with the machine enough to invent improvements to it. As for
conformism, that aspect of his critique is weak. What Illich should more
rightly critique is the <em>simplicity</em> of these tools, or
specificity of usage rather than specificity of application, and their
industrial rigidity that prevents their operators from becoming truly
skilled in them, and from developing improvements. This is a property
that convivial tools would enable because it is so crucial that they
allow their users to autonomously apply them to their own purposes, not
just the narrow set of predefined uses the designers imposed.</p>
