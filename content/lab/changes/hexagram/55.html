<h1>䷶  Hexagram 55. Fêng / Abundance [Fullness]</h1>
<title>䷶  Hexagram 55. Fêng / Abundance [Fullness]</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
         below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                         
  <p>  Chên is movement; Li is flame, whose attribute is clarity. Clarity
    within, movement without-this produces greatness and abundance. The hexagram
    pictures a period of advanced civilization. However, the fact that development
    has reached a peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance
    cannot be maintained permanently.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  ABUNDANCE has success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The king attains abundance.<br>
         Be not sad.<br>
         Be like the sun at midday.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding
    greatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it, because
    his will is directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance is usually
    brief. Therefore a sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that
  must  follow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly
  free  of sorrow and care can lead in a time of abundance. He must be like
  the sun  at midday, illuminating and gladdening everything under heaven.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Both thunder and lightning come:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of ABUNDANCE.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man decides lawsuits<br>
         And carries out punishments.</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram has a certain connection with <a href="21.html">Shih Ho, BITING THROUGH</a>,
  in which thunder and lightning similarly appear
    together, but in the reverse order. In BITING THROUGH, laws are laid
down;     here they are applied and enforced. Clarity [Li] within makes it
possible     to investigate the facts exactly, and shock [Chên] without
ensures    a strict and precise carrying out of punishments.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  When a man meets his destined ruler,</p>
                         
  <p>  They can be together ten days,<br>
         And it is not a mistake.<br>
         Going meets with recognition.</p>
                         
  <p>  To bring about a time of abundance, a union of clarity with energetic
    movement is needed. Two individuals possessed of these two attributes
are    suited to each other, and even if they spend an entire cycle of time
together    during the period of abundance, it will not be too long, nor
is it a mistake.    Therefore one may go forth, in order to make one's influence
felt; it will    meet with recognition.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The curtain is of such fullness</p>
                         
  <p>  That the polestars can be seen at noon.</p>
                         
  <p>  Through going one meets with mistrust and hate.<br>
         If one rouses him through truth,<br>
         Good fortune comes.</p>
                         
  <p>  It often happens that plots and party intrigues, which have the darkening
    effect of an eclipse of the sun, come between a ruler intent on great
achievement    and the man who could effect great undertakings. Then, instead
of the sun,    we see the northern stars in the sky. The ruler is overshadowed
by a party    that has usurped power. If a man at such a time were to try
to take energetic    measures, he would encounter only mistrust and envy,
which would prohibit    all movement. The essential thing then is to hold
inwardly to the power  of  truth, which in the end is so strong that it exerts
an invisible influence    on the ruler, so that all goes well.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The underbrush is of such abundance</p>
                         
  <p>  That the small stars can be seen at noon.<br>
         He breaks his right arm . No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  The image is that of a progressive covering over of the sun.  Here
    the eclipse reaches totality, therefore even the small stars can be seen
   at noon.  In the sphere of social relationships, this means that the prince
   is now so eclipsed that even the most insignificant persons can push themselves
    into the foreground. This makes it impossible for an able man, though
he   might be the right hand of the ruler, to undertake anything. It is as
though   his arm were broken, but he is not to blame for being thus hindered
in action.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The curtain is of such fullness</p>
                         
  <p>  That the polestars can be seen at noon.<br>
         He meets his ruler, who is of like kind.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the darkness is already decreasing, therefore interrelated elements
    come together. Here too the complement must be found-the necessary wisdom
    to complement joy of action. Then everything will go well. The complementary
    factor postulated here is the reverse of the one in the first line. In
 the   latter, wisdom is to be complemented by energy, while here energy
is  complemented   by wisdom.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Lines are coming,<br>
         Blessing and fame draw near.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The ruler is modest and therefore open to the counsel of able men.
    Thus he is surrounded by men who suggest to him the lines of action.
This     brings blessing, fame, and good fortune to him and all the people.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  His house is in a state of abundance.<br>
         He screens off his family.<br>
         He peers through the gate<br>
         And no longer perceives anyone.<br>
         For three years he sees nothing.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a man who because of his arrogance and obstinacy attains
    the opposite of what he strives for. He seeks abundance and splendor
for    his dwelling. He wishes at all odds to be master in his house, which
so  alienates   his family that in the end he finds himself completely isolated.</p>
