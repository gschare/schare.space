<title>䷎  Hexagram 15. Ch'ien / Modesty</title>

  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  KEN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is made up of the trigrams Kên, Keeping Still,
    mountain, and K'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative,
the    representative of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of
heaven,    the clouds and rain that gather round its summit, and thereafter
shines  forth  radiant with heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and
how it  functions  in great and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above.
Lowliness  is a quality  of the earth: this is the very reason why it appears
in this  hexagram as exalted, by being placed above the mountain. This shows
how modesty  functions in lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  MODESTY creates success.</p>
                         
  <p>.  The superior man carries things through.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what
    is modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law
  of  heaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a
new  dawn.  In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins
to wane,  and  when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works
itself out  in  the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the
full and to  contribute  to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the
waters, and  the valleys  are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine
what is full  and to prosper  the modest. And men also hate fullness and
love the modest.   The destinies  of men are subject to immutable laws that
must fulfill themselves.  But man  has it in his power to shape his fate,
according as his behavior  exposes him to the influence of benevolent or
of destructive forces. When  a man holds  a high position and is nevertheless
modest, he shines with the  light of wisdom;  if he is in a lowly position
and is modest, he cannot be  passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out
his work to the end without  boasting of what he has achieved.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Within the earth, a mountain:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of MODESTY.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,<br>
         And augments that which is too little.<br>
         He weighs things and makes them equal.</p>
                         
  <p>  The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible
    to the eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain.
   Thus high and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here
  an effect that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems
 easy of accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty.
 The superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world;
 he equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby
   creates just and equable conditions.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A superior man modest about his modesty<br>
         May cross the great water.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great stream, is
    made much more difficult if many claims and considerations have to be
taken    into account. On the other hand, the task is easy if it is attended
to quickly   and simply. Therefore the unassuming attitude of mind that goes
 with modesty   fits a man to accomplish even difficult undertakings: he
imposes  no demands   or stipulations but settles matters easily and quickly.
Where  no claims are  put forward, no resistances arise.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Modesty that comes to expression. Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  "Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh." When a man's
    attitude of mind is so modest that this expresses itself in his outward
  behavior,  it is a source of good fortune to him. For the possibility of
 exerting a lasting influence arises of itself and no one can interfere.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A superior man of modesty and merit<br>
         Carries things to conclusion.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This is the center of the hexagram, where its secret is disclosed.
    A distinguished name is readily earned by great achievements. If a man
 allows   himself to be dazzled by fame, he will soon be criticized, and
difficulties     will arise. If, on the contrary, he remains modest despite
his merit, he   makes himself beloved and wins the support necessary for
carrying his work   through to the end.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing that would not further modesty<br>
         In movement.</p>
                         
  <p>  Everything has its proper measure. Even modesty in behavior can be
    carried too far. Here, however, it is appropriate, because the place
between     a worthy helper below and a kindly ruler above carries great
responsibility.     The confidence of the man in superior place must not
be abused nor the  merits   of the man in inferior placed concealed. There
are officials who  indeed do  not strive for prominence; they hide behind
the letter of ordinances,   decline  all responsibility, accept pay without
giving its equivalent in  work, and  bear empty titles. This is the opposite
of what is meant here by modesty.  In such a position, modesty is shown by
interest in one's work.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  No boasting of wealth before one's neighbor. <br>
         It is favorable to attack with force.<br>
         Nothing that would not further.</p>
                         
  <p>  Modesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets things
    take their own course. When a man holds a responsible position, he must
  at  times resort to energetic measures. In doing so he must not try to
make   an  impression by boasting of his superiority but must make certain
of the   people  around him. The measures taken should be purely objective
and in  no way personally  offensive. Thus modesty manifests itself even
in severity.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Modesty that comes to expression.<br>
         It is favorable to set armies marching<br>
         To chastise one's own city and one's country.</p>
                         
  <p>  A person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it show in
    reality. He must proceed with great energy in this. When enmity arises
 nothing   is easier than to lay the blame on another. A weak man takes offense
 perhaps,   and draws back, feeling self-pity; he thinks that it is modesty
 that keeps   him from defending himself. Genuine modesty sets one to creating
 order and   inspires one to begin by disciplining one's own ego and one's
 immediate circle.  Only through having the courage to marshal one's armies
 against oneself, will something forceful really be achieved.</p>
