<title>䷋  Hexagram 12. P'i / Standstill [Stagnation]</title>

<p id="alternative">

<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
         below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above,
    drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther
into    the depths. The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time
of standstill    and decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month
(August-September),    when the year has passed its zenith and autumnal decay
is setting in.   </p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  STANDSTILL. Evil people do not further<br>
         The perseverance of the superior man.<br>
         The great departs; the small approaches.</p>
                         
  <p>  Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed.
    What is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion
 and   disorder prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without.
  Weakness  is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without
  are the  superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of
superior   people  is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow
themselves   to be  turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting
influence   is  closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their
principles   and  withdraw into seclusion.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Heaven and earth do not unite:<br>
         The image of STANDSTILL.<br>
         Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth <br>
         In order to escape the difficulties.<br>
         He does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.</p>
                         
  <p>  When, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails
    in public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the
fundaments    are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do
under such circumstances;   he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling
offers to take part in  public activities. This would only expose him to
danger, since he cannot  assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore
hides his worth and withdraws   into seclusion.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br>
         Each according to his kind.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune and success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The text is almost the same as that of the first line of the preceding
    hexagram, but with a contrary meaning. In the latter a man is drawing
another    along with him on the road to an official career; here a man is
drawing  another  with him into retirement form public life. This is why
the text says here,  "Perseverance brings good fortune and success," and
not "Undertakings  bring  good fortune." If it becomes impossible to make
our influence count,  it is  only by retirement that we spare ourselves humiliation.
Success in  a higher  sense can be ours, because we know how to safeguard
the value of  our personalities.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  They bear and endure;<br>
         This means good fortune for inferior people.<br>
         The standstill serves to help the great man to attain success.</p>
                         
  <p>  Inferior people are ready to flatter their superiors in a servile
way. They would also endure the superior man if he would put an end to their
confusion. This is fortunate for them. But the great man calmly bears the
consequences of the standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd of the
inferior; that is not his place. By his willingness to suffer personally
he insures the success of his fundamental principles.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  They bear shame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Inferior people who have risen to power illegitimately do not feel
    equal to the responsibility they have taken upon themselves. In their
hearts    they begin to be ashamed, although at first they do not show it
outwardly.    This marks a turn for the better. </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He who acts at the command of the highest <br>
         Remains without blame.<br>
         Those of like mind partake of the blessing.</p>
                         
  <p>  The time of standstill is nearing the point of change into its opposite.
    Whoever wishes to restore order must feel himself called to the task
and    have the necessary authority. A man who sets himself up a capable
of creating    order according to his own judgment could make mistakes and
end in failure.    But the man who is truly called to the task is favored
by the conditions   of the time, and all those of like mind will share in
his blessing.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Standstill is giving way.<br>
         Good fortune for the great man.<br>
         "What if it should fail, what if it should fail?"<br>
         In this way he ties it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.</p>
                         
  <p>  The time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order,
    has arrived. Hence "good fortune." But such periods of transition are
the    very times in which we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only
through    greatest caution, which asks always, "What if it should fail?"
When a mulberry    bush is cut down, a number of unusually strong shoots
sprout from the roots.    Hence the image of tying something to a cluster
of mulberry shoots is used    to symbolize the way of making success certain.
Confucius says about this    line:</p>
                         
  <p>  Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction
    threatens when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion
develops     when a man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior
man does   not  forget danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established,
  nor confusion when his affairs are in order. In this way he gains personal
  safety and is able to protect the empire.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The standstill comes to an end.<br>
         First standstill, then good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The standstill does not last forever. However, it does not cease of
    its own accord; the right man is needed to end it. This is the difference
    between a state of peace and a state of stagnation. Continuous effort
is   necessary to maintain peace: left to itself it would change into stagnation
   and disintegration. The time of disintegration, however, does not change
  back automatically to a condition of peace and prosperity; effort must
be   put forth in order to end it. This shows the creative attitude that
man must  take if the world is to be put in order.</p>
