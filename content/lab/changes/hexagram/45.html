<h1>䷬  Hexagram 45.  Ts'ui / Gathering Together [Massing]</h1>
<title>䷬  Hexagram 45.  Ts'ui / Gathering Together [Massing]</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE<br>
         below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is related in form and meaning to <a href="8.html">Pi, HOLDING TOGETHER</a>. In the latter, water is over the earth; here a
    lake is over the earth. But since the lake is a place where water collects,
    the idea of gathering together is even more strongly expressed here than
   in the other hexagram. The same idea also arises from the fact that in
the   present case it is two strong lines (the fourth and the fifth) that
bring   about the gather together, whereas in the former case one strong
line (the   fifth) stands in the midst of weak lines.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  GATHERING TOGETHER. Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The king approaches his temple.<br>
         It furthers one to see the great man.</p>
                         
  <p>  This brings success. Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  To bring great offerings creates good fortune.<br>
         It furthers one to undertake something.</p>
                         
  <p>  The gathering together of people in large communities is either a
natural occurrence, as in the case of the family, or an artificial one, as
in the case of the state. The family gathers about the father as its head.
The perpetuation of this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice
to the ancestors, at which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the
collective piety of the living members of the family, the ancestors become
so integrated in the spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed
or dissolved.  Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are
needed. But there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the
group. In order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first
of all be collected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite
the world. Such great times of unification will leave great achievements
behind them. This is the significance of the great offerings that are made.
In the secular sphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time
of GATHERING TOGETHER.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Over the earth, the lake:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of GATHERING TOGETHER.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man renews his weapons<br>
         In order to meet the unforeseen.</p>
                         
  <p>  If the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there
    is danger of a break-through. Precautions must be taken to prevent this.
   Similarly where men gather together in great numbers, strife is likely
to   arise; where possessions are collected, robbery is likely to occur.
Thus  in the time of GATHERING TOGETHER we must arm promptly to ward off
the unexpected.   Human woes usually come as a result of unexpected events
against which we   are not forearmed. If we are prepared, they can be prevented.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If you are sincere, but not to the end,</p>
                         
  <p>  There will sometimes be confusion, sometimes gathering together.<br>
         If you call out, </p>
                         
  <p>  Then after one grasp of the hand you can laugh again.<br>
         Regret not. Going is without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation is this:  People desire to gather around a leader to
    whom they look up. But they are in a large group, by which they allow
themselves    to be influenced, so that they waver in their decision. Thus
they lack a  firm center around which to gather. But if expression is given
to this need,  and if they call for help, one grasp of the hand from the
leader is enough  to turn away all distress. Therefore they must not allow
themselves to be  led astray. It is undoubtedly right that they should attach
themselves to  this leader.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Letting oneself be drawn<br>
         Brings good fortune and remains blameless.<br>
         If one is sincere,<br>
         It furthers one to bring even a small offering.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the time of GATHERING TOGETHER, we should make no arbitrary choice
    of the way. There are secret forces at work, leading together those who
  belong  together. We must yield to this attraction; then we make no mistakes.
  Where  inner relationships exist, no great preparations and formalities
are  necessary.  People understand one another forthwith, just as the Divinity
  graciously accepts a small offering if it comes from the heart.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Gathering together amid sighs.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing that would further.<br>
         Going is without blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Slight humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  Often a man feels an urge to unite with others, but the individuals
    around him have already formed themselves into a group, so that he remains
    isolated. The whole situation proves untenable. Then he ought to choose
  the  way of progress, resolutely allying himself with a man who stands
nearer    to the center of the group, and can help him to gain admission
to the closed     circle. This is not a mistake, even though at first his
position as an  outsider   is somewhat humiliating.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p> Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Great good fortune. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  This describes a man who gathers people around him in the name of
his ruler. Since he is not striving for any special advantages for himself
but is working unselfishly to bring about general unity, his work is crowned
with success, and everything becomes as it should be.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If in gathering together one has position,</p>
                         
  <p>  This brings no blame.<br>
         If there are some who are not yet sincerely in the work,</p>
                         
  <p>  Sublime and enduring perseverance is needed.</p>
                         
  <p>  Then remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  When people spontaneously gather around a man, it is only a good.
It gives him a certain influence that can be altogether useful.. But of course
    there is also the possibility that many may gather around him not because
    of a feeling of confidence but merely because of his influential position.
    This is certainly to be regretted. The only means of dealing with such
 people   is to gain their confidence through steadfastness an intensified,
 unswerving   devotion to duty. In this way secret mistrust will gradually
 be overcome,   and there will be no occasion for regret.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  It may happen that an individual would like to ally himself with another,
    but his good intentions are misunderstood. Then he becomes sad and laments.
    But this is the right course. For it may cause the other person to come
  to  his senses, so that the alliance that has been sought and so painfully
  missed  is after all achieved.</p>
