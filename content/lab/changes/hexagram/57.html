  <p>  Sun is one of the eight doubled trigrams. It is the eldest daughter
    and symbolizes wind or wood; it has for its attribute gentleness, which
  nonetheless  penetrates like the wind or like growing wood with its roots.
   The dark principle,  in itself rigid and immovable, is dissolved by the
 penetrating light principle,  to which it subordinates itself in gentleness.
 In nature, it is the wind that disperses the gathered clouds, leaving the
 sky clear and serene. In human life it is penetrating clarity of judgment
 that thwarts all dark hidden motives. In the life of the community it is
the powerful influence of a great personality that uncovers and breaks up
those intrigues which shun the light of day.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE GENTLE. Success through what is small.<br>
         It furthers one to have somewhere to go.<br>
         It furthers one to see the great man.</p>
                         
  <p>  Penetration produces gradual and inconspicuous effects. It should
be effected not by an act of violation but by influence that never lapses.
Results of this kind are less striking to the eye than those won by surprise
attack, but they are more enduring and more complete. If one would produce
such effects, one must have a clearly defined goal, for only when the penetrating
influence works always in the same direction can the object be attained.
Small strength can achieve its purpose only by subordinating itself to an
eminent man who is capable of creating order.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Winds following one upon the other:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE GENTLY PENETRATING.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man </p>
                         
  <p>  Spreads his commands abroad<br>
         And carries out his undertakings.</p>
                         
  <p>  The penetrating quality of the wind depends upon its ceaselessness.
    This is what makes it so powerful; time is its instrument. In the same
 way   the ruler's thought should penetrate the soul of the people. This
too  requires   a lasting influence brought about by enlightenment and command.
 Only when   the command has been assimilated by the people is action in
accordance  with   it possible. Action without preparation of the ground
only frightens  and  repels.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  In advancing and in retreating,</p>
                         
  <p>  The perseverance of a warrior furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  In born gentleness is often carried to the point of indecisiveness.
    One does not feel strong enough to advance resolutely. A thousand doubts
   crop up; one is, however, not minded to withdraw but drifts indecisively
  to and fro. In such a situation, a military decisiveness is the proper
thing,    so that one resolutely does what order demands. Resolute discipline
is far   better than irresolute license.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Penetration under the bed.<br>
         Priests and magicians are used in great number.<br>
         Good fortune. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  At times one has to deal with hidden enemies, intangible influences
    that slink into dark corners and from this hiding affect people by suggestion.
    In instances like this, it is necessary to trace these things back to
the    most secret recesses, in order to determine the nature of the influences
   to be dealt with. This is the task of the priests; removing the influences
   is the task of the magicians. The very anonymity of such plotting requires
   an especially vigorous and indefatigable effort, but this is well worth
 while.   For when such elusive influences are brought into the light and
branded,  they lose their power over people.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Repeated penetration. Humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  Penetrating reflection must not be pushed too far, lest it cripple
    the power of decision. After a matter has been thoroughly pondered, it
 is   essential to form a decision and to act. Repeated deliberation brings
 fresh   doubts and scruples, and thereby humiliation, because one shows
oneself   unable  to act.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Remorse vanishes.<br>
         During the hunt</p>
                         
  <p>  Three kinds of game are caught.</p>
                         
  <p>  When a responsible position and accumulated experience lead one to
    combine innate modesty with energetic action, great success is assured.
  The  three kinds of animals referred to served for offerings to the gods,
  for feasting guests, and for everyday consumption. When the catch answered
  all three purposes, the hunt was considered especially successful.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         Remorse vanishes.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing that does not further.</p>
                         
  <p>  No beginning, but an end.<br>
         Before the change, three days.<br>
         After the change, three days.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the situation described in <a href="18.html">Ku, WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED</a>, an entirely new point of departure must be set
    up, whereas here it is only a question of reforms. The beginning has
not    been good, but the moment has been reached when a new direction can
be taken.   Change and improvement are called for. Such steps must be undertaken
with   steadfastness, that is, with a firm and correct attitude of mind;
then they   will succeed, and remorse will disappear. But it must be remembered
 that  such improvements require careful consideration. Before a change is
 made,  it must be pondered over again and again. After the change is made,
 it is  necessary to note carefully for some time after how the improvements
 bear  the test of actuality. Such careful work is accompanied by good fortune.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Penetration under the bed.<br>
         He loses his property and his ax.<br>
         Perseverance brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man's understanding is sufficiently penetrating. He follows up injurious
    influences into the most secret corners. But he no longer has the strength
    to combat them decisively. In this case any attempt to penetrate into
the    personal domain of darkness would only bring harm.</p>
