<title>䷫  Hexagram 44. Kou / Coming to Meet</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
         below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram indicates a situation in which the principle of darkness,
    after having been eliminated, furtively and unexpectedly obtrudes again
  from  within and below. Of its own accord the female principle comes to
meet  the  male. It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must
understand    and promptly prevent the possible consequences.  The hexagram
is linked  with  the fifth month [June-July], because at the summer solstice
the principle    of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again. </p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  COMING TO MEET. The maiden is powerful.<br>
         One should not marry such a maiden.</p>
                         
  <p>  The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of
a bold girl who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power. This would
    not be possible if the strong and light-giving element had not in turn
 come   halfway. The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a
man delights   in it; it looks so small and weak that he imagines he may
dally with it and  come to no harm.  The inferior man rises only because
the superior man does  not regard him as dangerous and so lends him power.
If he were resisted from  the fist, he could never gain influence.  The time
of COMING TO MEET is important  in still another way. Although as a general
rule the weak should  not come  to meet the strong, there are times when
this has great significance.  When  heaven and earth come to meet each other,
all creatures prosper; when  a prince  and his official come to meet each
other, the world is put in order.  It is  necessary for elements predestined
to be joined and mutually dependent  to  come to meet one another halfway.
But the coming together must be free  of  dishonest ulterior motives, otherwise
 harm will result.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Under heaven, wind:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of COMING TO MEET.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands<br>
         And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation here resembles that in hexagram 20, Kuan, CONTEMPLATION
    ( VIEW). In the latter the wind blows over the earth, here it blows under
    heaven; in both cases it goes everywhere. There the wind is on the earth
   and symbolizes the ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom;
here   the wind blows from above and symbolizes the influence exercised by
the ruler   through his commands. Heaven is far from the things of earth,
but it sets   them in motion by means of the wind. The ruler is far form
his people, but   he sets them in motion by means of his commands and decrees.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  It must be checked with a brake of bronze.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.<br>
         Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.</p>
                         
  <p>  If an inferior element has wormed its way in, it must be energetically
    checked at once. By consistently checking it, bad effects can be avoided.
    If it is allowed to take its course, misfortune is bound to result; the
  insignificance  of that which creeps in should not be a temptation to underrate
  it. A pig  that is still young and lean cannot rage around much, but after
  it has eaten  its fill and become strong, its true nature comes out if
it   has not previously  been curbed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  There is a fish in the tank. No blame.<br>
         Does not further guests.</p>
                         
  <p>  The inferior element is not overcome by violence but is kept under
    gentle control. Then nothing evil is to be feared. But care must be taken
    not to let it come in contact with those further away, because once free
   it would unfold its evil aspects unchecked.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means: There is no skin on his thighs,<br>
         And walking comes hard.<br>
         If one is mindful of the danger,</p>
                         
  <p>  No great mistake is made.</p>
                         
  <p>  There is a temptation to fall in with the evil element offering itself-a
    very dangerous situation. Fortunately circumstances prevent this; one
would    like to do it, but cannot. This leads to painful indecision in behavior.
   But if we gain clear insight into the danger of the situation, we shall
 at  least avoid more serious mistakes.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  No fish in the tank.</p>
                         
  <p>  This leads to misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Insignificant people must be tolerated in order to keep them well
disposed. Then we can make use of them if we should need them. If we become
alienated from them and do not meet them halfway, they turn their backs on
us and are not at our disposal when we need them. But this is our own fault.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A melon covered with willow leaves.<br>
         Hidden lines.</p>
                         
  <p>  Then it drops down to one from heave.</p>
                         
  <p>  The melon, like the fish, is a symbol of the principle of darkness.
    It is sweet but spoils easily and for this reason is protected with a
cover    of willow leaves. This is a situation in which a strong, superior,
well-poised    man tolerates and protects the inferiors in his charge.  He
has the firm   lines of order an beauty within himself but he does not lay
stress upon them.  He does not bother his subordinates with outward show
or tiresome admonitions   but leaves them quite free, putting his trust in
the transforming power of  a strong and upright personality. And behold!
Fate is favorable. His inferiors  respond to his influence and fall to his
disposition like ripe fruit.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He comes to meet with his horns.<br>
         Humiliation. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  When a man has withdrawn from the world, its tumult often becomes
unbearable to him. There are many people who in a noble pride hold themselves
aloof from all that is low and rebuff it brusquely wherever it comes to meet
them. Such persons are reproached for being proud and distant, but since
active duties no longer hold them to the world, this does not greatly matter.
They know how to bear the dislike of the masses with composure.</p>
