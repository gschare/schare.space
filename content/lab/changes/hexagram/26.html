<h1>䷙  Hexagram 26. Ta Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Great</h1>
<title>䷙  Hexagram 26. Ta Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Great</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                         
  <p>  The Creative is tamed by Kên, Keeping Still.  This produces
great power, a situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao
Ch'u, THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the
Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four
strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister,
there is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger.
 The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the
concept "Holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding
firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram Kên which holds
the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of
holding back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring
for and nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line
at the top, which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as
a sage. The third of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong
line at the top, which represents the sage.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Not eating at home brings good fortune.<br>
         It furthers one to cross the great water.</p>
                         
  <p>  To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set
forth in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is
honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power;
Kên indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and
to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can
a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep
order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of
energy, everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since
the worthy are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted
with leadership by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather
to earn one's bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony
with heaven; therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing
the great water, succeed.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Heaven within the mountain:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity<br>
         And many deeds of the past,<br>
         In order to strengthen his character thereby.</p>
                         
  <p>  Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words
    and deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to
 strengthen   and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past
is not to confine   oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application
 of this knowledge,   to give actuality to the past.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Danger is at hand. It furthers one to desist.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man wishes to make vigorous advance, but circumstances present an
    obstacle. He sees himself held back firmly. If he should attempt to fore
   an advance, it would lead him into misfortune. Therefore it is better
for    him to compose himself and to wait until an outlet is offered for
release    of his stored-up energies.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The axletrees are taken from the wagon.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here advance is checked just as in the third line of <a href="9.html">THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL</a> However, in the later the restraining force is
    slight; thus a conflict arises between the propulsive and the restraining
    movement, as a result of which the spokes fall out of the wagon wheels,
  while  here the restraining force is absolutely superior; hence no struggle
  takes  place. One submits and removes the axletrees from the wagon -in
other   words,  contents himself with waiting. In this way energy accumulates
for   a vigorous  advance later on.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means.<br>
         A good horse that follows others.<br>
         Awareness of danger,<br>
         With perseverance, furthers.<br>
         Practice chariot driving and armed defense daily. <br>
         It furthers one to have somewhere to go.</p>
                         
  <p>  The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away. A man is in contact
    with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes
forward     like one good horse following another. But danger still threatens,
and  he   must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness.
Thus he must   acquire skill on the one hand in what will take him forward,
and on the other  in what will protect him against unforeseen attacks. It
is good in such a  pass to have a goal toward which to strive.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The headboard of a young bull.<br>
         Great good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This line and the one following it are the two that tame the forward-pushing
    lower lines. Before a bull's horns grow out, a headboard is fastened
to   its  forehead, so that later when the horns appear they cannot do harm.
A  good  way to restrain wild force is to forestall it. By so doing one achieves
  an  easy and great success.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
      <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The tusk of a gelded boar.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the restraining of the impetuous forward drive is achieved in
    an indirect way. A boar's tusk is in itself dangerous, but if the boar's
   nature is altered, the tusk is no longer a menace. Thus also where men
are   concerned, wild force should not be combated directly; instead, its
roots   should be eradicated.</p>

  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p> Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One attains the way of heaven.</p>
                         
  <p>  Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up by inhibition
    forces its way out and achieves great success. This refers to a man who
  is  honored by the ruler and whose principles now prevail and shape the
world.      </p>
