<title>䷢  Hexagram 35. Chin / Progress</title>

  <p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
         below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                         
  <p>  The hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth. It is therefore
    the symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever
widening    expansion and clarity.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  PROGRESS. The powerful prince<br>
         Is honored with horses in large numbers.<br>
         In a single day he is granted audience three times.</p>
                         
  <p>  As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal
    lord rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty
and    peace. The sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer
intimacy.</p>
                         
  <p>    A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress
    emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others
 regard   as their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader
has enough   clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use
it rather for  the benefit of his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all
jealousy, showers  presents on the great man, and invites him continually
to his court. An enlightened  ruler and an obedient servant--this is the
condition on which  great progress  depends.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  The sun rises over the earth:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of PROGRESS.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man himself<br>
         Brightens his bright virtue.</p>
                         
  <p>  The light of the sun rises over the earth is by nature clear. The
higher the sun rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading
the pristine purity of its rays over an ever widening area. The real nature
of man is likewise originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with
earthly things and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth
in its native clarity.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Progressing, but turned back.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         If one meets with no confidence, one should remain calm.</p>
                         
  <p>  No mistake.</p>
                         
  <p>  At a time when all elements are pressing for progress, we are still
    uncertain whether in the course of advance we may not meet with a rebuff.
    Then the thing to do is simply continue in what is right; in the end
this     will bring good fortune. It may be that we meet with no confidence.
In  this   case we ought not to try to win confidence regardless of the situation,
  but  should remain calm and cheerful and refuse to be roused to anger.
Thus   we  remain free of mistakes.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Progressing, but in sorrow.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Then one obtains great happiness from one's ancestress.</p>
                         
  <p>  Progress is halted; an individual is kept from getting in touch with
    the man in authority with whom he has a connection. When this happens,
 he   must remain persevering, although he is grieved; then with a maternal
 gentleness   the man in question will bestow great happiness upon him. This
 happiness  comes to him-and is well deserved-because in this case mutual
attraction does not rest on selfish or partisan motives but on firm and correct
principles.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  All are in accord. Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man strives onward, in association with others whose backing encourages
    him. This dispels any cause for regret over the fact that he does not
have    enough independence to triumph unaided over every hostile turn of
fate.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Progress like a hamster.<br>
         Perseverance brings danger.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places
    to amass great possessions. But such conduct shuns the light. And since
  times  of progress are inevitably brought to the light, perseverance in
such  action  always leads to danger.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  Take not gain and loss to heart.<br>
         Undertakings bring good fortune.<br>
         Everything serves to further.</p>
                         
  <p>  The situation described here is that of one who, finding himself in
    an influential position in a time of progress, remains gentle and reserved.
    He might reproach himself for lack of energy in making the most of the
 propitiousness   of the time and obtaining all possible advantage. However,
 this regret passes   away. He must not take either loss or gain to heart;
 they are minor considerations.   What matters much more is the fact that
in this way he has assured himself   of opportunities for successful and
beneficent influence.   </p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Making progress with the horns is permissible<br>
         Only for the purpose of punishing one's own city.</p>
                         
  <p>  To be conscious of danger brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame. <br>
         Perseverance brings humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  Making progress with lowered horns-i.e., acting on the offensive-is
    permissible, in times like those referred to here, only in dealing with
  the  mistakes of one's own people. Even then we must bear in mind that
proceeding     on the offensive may always be dangerous. In this way we avoid
the mistakes     that otherwise threaten, and succeed in what we set out
to do. On the other    hand, perseverance in such over energetic behavior,
especially toward persons    with whom there is no close connection, will
lead to humiliation.</p>
