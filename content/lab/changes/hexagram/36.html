<title>䷣  Hexagram 36. Ming I / Darkening of the light</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the sun has sunk under the earth and is therefore darkened. The
    name of the hexagram means literally "wounding of the bright"; hence
the    individual lines contain frequent references to wounding. The situation
 is  the exact opposite of that in the foregoing hexagram. In the latter
a  wise  man at the head of affairs has able helpers, and in company with
them  makes  progress; here a man of dark nature is in a position of authority
and brings  harm to the wise and able man.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  DARKENING OF THE LIGHT. In adversity<br>
         It furthers one to be persevering.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  One must not unresistingly let himself be swept along by unfavorable
    circumstances, nor permit his steadfastness to be shaken. He can avoid
 this   by maintaining his inner light, while remaining outwardly yielding
 and tractable.   With this attitude he can overcome even the greatest adversities.
   In some   situations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make
 his will prevail   inspite of difficulties in his immediate environment.
Perseverance must dwell  in inmost consciousness and should not be discernible
from without. Only thus is a man able to maintain his will in the face of
difficulties.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  The light has sunk into the earth:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of DARKENING OF THE LIGHT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus does the superior man live with the great mass:<br>
         He veils his light, yet still shines.</p>
                         
  <p>  In a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved.
    One should not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate
behavior.    In such times one ought not to fall in with the practices of
others; neither    should one drag them censoriously into the light.  In
social intercourse   one should not try to be all-knowing. One should let
many things pass, without    being duped.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Darkening of the light during flight.<br>
         He lowers his wings.</p>
                         
  <p>  The superior man does not eat for three days<br>
         On his wanderings.<br>
         But he has somewhere to go.</p>
                         
  <p>  The host has occasion to gossip about him.</p>
                         
  <p>  With grandiose resolve a man endeavors to soar above all obstacles,
    but thus encounters a hostile fate. He retreats and evades the issue.
The    time is difficult. Without rest, he must hurry along, with no permanent
  abiding  place. If he does not want to make compromises within himself,
but  insists  on remaining true to his principles, he suffers deprivation.
Never  the less  he has a fixed goal to strive for even though the people
with whom  he lives  do not understand him and speak ill of him.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Darkening of the light injures him in the left thigh.<br>
         He gives aid with the strength of a horse.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the Lord of Light is in a subordinate place and is wounded by
    the Lord of Darkness. But the injury is not fatal; it is only a hindrance.
    Rescue is still possible. The wounded man gives no thought to himself;
 he   thinks only of saving the others who are also in danger. Therefore
he  tries   with all his strength to save all that can be saved. There is
good  fortune   in thus acting according to duty.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south.</p>
                         
  <p>  Their great leader is captured.<br>
         One must not expect perseverance too soon.</p>
                         
  <p>  It seems as if chance were at work. While the strong, loyal man is
    striving eagerly and in good faith to create order, he meets the ringleader
    of the disorder, as if by accident, and seizes him. Thus victory is achieved.
    But in abolishing abuses one must not be too hasty.  This would turn
out    badly because the abuses have been in existence so long.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He penetrates the left side of the belly.<br>
         One gets at the very heart of the darkening of the light.</p>
                         
  <p>  We find ourselves close to the commander of darkness and so discover
    his mot secret thoughts. In this way we realize that there is no longer
  any  hope of improvement, and thus we are enabled to leave the scene of
disaster    before the storm breaks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Darkening of the light as with Prince Chi.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Prince Chi lived at the court of the evil tyrant Chou Hsin, who, although
    not mentioned by name, furnished the historical example on which this
whole    situation is based. Prince Chi was a relative of the tyrant and
could not    withdraw from the court; therefore he concealed his true sentiments
 and  feigned  insanity. Although he was held a slave, he did not allow external
  misery to deflect him from his convictions.  This provides a teaching for
  those who cannot leave their posts in times of darkness. In order to escape
  danger,  they need invincible perseverance of spirit and redoubled caution
  in their  dealings with the world.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Not light but darkness.<br>
         First he climbed up to heaven,</p>
                         
  <p>  Then plunged into the depths of the earth.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the climax of the darkening is reached. The dark power at first
    held so high a place that it could wound all who were on the side of
good     and of the light. But in the end it perishes of its own darkness,
for evil    must itself fall at the very moment when it has wholly overcome
the good,    and thus consumed the energy to which it owed its duration.
