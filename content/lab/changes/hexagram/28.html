<h1>䷛  Hexagram 28. Ta Kuo / Preponderance of the Great</h1>
<title>䷛  Hexagram 28. Ta Kuo / Preponderance of the Great</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE<br>
         below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram consists of four strong lines inside and two weak lines
    outside. When the strong are outside and the weak inside, all is well
and    there is nothing out of balance, nothing extraordinary in the situation.
   Here, however, the opposite is the case. The hexagram represents a beam
 that  is thick and heavy in the middle but too weak at the ends. This is
a condition   that cannot last; it must be changed, must pass, or misfortune
 will result.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.</p>
                         
  <p>  The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.<br>
         It furthers one to have somewhere to go.</p>
                         
  <p>  Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  The weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the
    strength of the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests,
 sags   to the breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for
 the load  they bear. It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore
extraordinary     measures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of
transition as quickly    as possible, and to take action. This promises success.
For although the   strong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that
is, at the center   of gravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared.
Nothing is to be achieved    by forcible measures. The problem must be solved
by gently penetration to   the meaning of the situation (as is suggested
by the attribute of the inner   trigram, Sun); then the change-over to other
conditions will be successful.    It demands real superiority; therefore
the time when the great preponderates    is a momentous time.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  The lake rises above the trees:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,<br>
         Is unconcerned,<br>
         And if he has to renounce the world,<br>
         He is undaunted.</p>
                         
  <p>  Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times
    when the lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are temporary.
    The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times:
   the symbol of the trigram Sun is the tree, which stands firm even though
  it stands alone, and the attribute of Tui is joyousness, which remains
undaunted    even if it must renounce the world.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  To spread white rushes underneath.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  When a man wishes to undertake an enterprise in extraordinary times,
    he must be extraordinarily cautious, just as when setting a heavy thing
  down  on the floor, one takes care to put rushes under it, so that nothing
  will  break. This caution, though it may seem exaggerated, is not a mistake.
  Exceptional  enterprises cannot succeed unless utmost caution is observed
  in their beginnings  and in the laying of their foundations.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A dry poplar sprouts at the root.<br>
         An older man takes a young wife.<br>
         Everything furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Wood is near water; hence the image of an old poplar sprouting at
the root. This means an extraordinary situation arises when an older man
marries a young girl who suits him. Despite the unusualness of the situation,
all goes well.  From the point of view of politics, the meaning is that in
exceptional times one does well to join with the lowly, for this affords
a possibility of renewal.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.<br>
         Misfortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  This indicates a type of man who in times of preponderance of the
great insists on pushing ahead. He accepts no advice from others, and therefore
    they in turn are not willing to lend him support. Because of this the
burden    grows, until the structure of things bends or breaks. Plunging
willfully   ahead in times of danger only hastens the catastrophe.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune.<br>
         If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating.</p>
                         
  <p>  Through friendly relations with people of lower rank, a responsible
    man succeeds in becoming master of the situation. But if, instead of
working     for the rescue of the whole, he were to misuse his connections
to obtain    personal power and success, it would lead to humiliation.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A withered poplar puts forth flowers.<br>
         An older woman takes a husband. </p>
                         
  <p>  No blame. No praise.</p>
                         
  <p>  A withered poplar that flowers exhausts its energies thereby and only
    hastens its end. An older woman may marry once more, but no renewal takes
    place. Everything remains barren. Thus, though all the amenities are
observed,     the net result is only the anomaly of the situation.  Applied
to politics,     the metaphor means that if in times of insecurity we give
up alliance with    those below us and keep up only the relationships we
have with people of   higher rank, an unstable situation is created.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One must go through the water.<br>
         It goes over one's head.<br>
         Misfortune. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here is a situation in which the unusual has reached a climax. One
    is courageous and wishes to accomplish one's task, no matter what happens.
    This leads into danger. The water rises over one's head. This is the
misfortune.     But one incurs no blame in giving up one's life that the
good and the right    may prevail. There are things that are more important
than life.   </p>
