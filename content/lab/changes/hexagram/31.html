<h1>䷞  Hexagram 31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)</h1>
<title>䷞  Hexagram 31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>

  <p>  above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE<br>
         below  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  The name of the hexagram means "universal," "general," and in a figurative
    sense "to influence," "to stimulate." The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous;
    the lower is Kên, Keeping still. By its persistent, quiet influence,
    the lower, rigid trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds
    to this stimulation cheerfully and joyously. Kên, the lower trigram,
    is the youngest son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter. Thus the
  universal  mutual attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship,
  the masculine  principle must seize the initiative and place itself below
  the feminine principle.   Just as the first part of book 1 begins with
the   hexagrams of heaven and  earth, the foundations of all that exists,
the second  part begins with the  hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the
foundations   of all social relationships.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  Influence. Success.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their powers attract
    each other, so that they unite. This brings about success, for all success
    depends on the effect of mutual attraction. By keeping still within while
    experiencing joy without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess
 and   hold it within proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition,
    "Perseverance furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference
    between seduction and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a
position    inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for
her. This  attraction  between affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven
and earth  attract each  other and thus all creatures come into being. Through
such attraction the  sage influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains
peace. From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings
in heaven and on earth.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  A lake on the mountain:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of influence.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him<br>
         By his readiness to receive them.</p>
                         
  <p>  A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture
    from the lake. It has this advantage because its summit does not jut
out    as a peak but is sunken. The image counsels that the mind should be
kept   humble and free, so that it may remain receptive to good advice. People
soon  give up counseling a man who thinks that he knows everything better
than anyone else.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The influence shows itself in the big toe.</p>
                         
  <p>  A movement, before it is actually carried out, shows itself first
in the toes. The idea of an influence is already present, but is not immediately
    apparent to others. As long as the intention has no visible effect, it
 is   of no importance to the outside world and leads neither to good nor
to evil.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Tarrying brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  In movement, the calf of the leg follows the foot; by itself it can
    neither go forward nor stand still. Since the movement is not self-governed,
    it bodes ill. One should wait quietly until one is impelled to action
by   a real influence. Then one remains uninjured.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The influence shows itself in the thighs.<br>
         Holds to that which follows it.</p>
                         
  <p>  To continue is humiliating.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  Every mood of the heart influences us to movement. What the heart
desires, the thighs run after without a moment's hesitation; they hold to
the heart, which they follow. In the life of man, however, acting on the
spur of every caprice is wrong and if continued leads to humiliation. Three
considerations suggest themselves here. First, a man should not run precipitately
after all the persons whom he would like to influence, but must be able to
hold back under certain circumstances. As little should he yield immediately
to every whim of those in whose service he stands. Finally, where the moods
of his own heart are concerned, he should never ignore the possibility of
inhibition, for this is the basis of human freedom.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p> Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         Remorse disappears.<br>
         If a man is agitated in mind,<br>
         And his thoughts go hither and thither,<br>
         Only those friends <br>
         On whom he fixes his conscious thoughts<br>
         Will follow.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the place of the heart is reached. The impulse that springs from
    this source is the most important of all. It is of particular concern
that    this influence be constant and good; then, in spite of the danger
arising    from the great susceptibility of the human heart, there will be
no cause   for remorse. When the quiet power of a man's own character is
at work, the   effects produced are right. All those who are receptive to
the vibrations   of such a spirit will then be influenced. Influence over
others should not   express itself as a conscious and willed effort to manipulate
them. Through   practicing such conscious incitement, one becomes wrought
up and is exhausted   by the eternal stress and strain. Moreover, the effects
produced are then   limited to those on whom one's thoughts are consciously
fixed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The influence shows itself in the back of the neck.</p>
                         
  <p>  No remorse.</p>
                         
  <p>  The back of the neck is the most rigid part of the body. When the
influence shows itself there, the will remains firm and the influence does
not lead to confusion. Hence remorse does not enter into consideration here.
What takes place in the depths of one's being, in the unconscious mind. It
is true that if we cannot be influenced ourselves, we cannot influence the
outside world.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks, and tongue.</p>
                         
  <p>  The most superficial way of trying to influence others is through
talk that has nothing real behind it. The influence produced by such mere
tongue wagging must necessarily remain insignificant. Hence no indication
is added regarding good or bad fortune.</p>
