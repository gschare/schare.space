<title>䷇  Hexagram 8. Pi / Holding Together [union]</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
         below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                         
  <p>  The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they
    can, as for example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together.
Symbolically    this connotes holding together and the laws that regulate
it. The same idea   is suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram
except the fifth,   the place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines
hold together because   they are influenced by a man of strong will in the
leading position, a man   who is their center of union. Moreover, this strong
and guiding personality   in turn holds together with the others, finding
in them the complement of   his own nature.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.<br>
         Inquire of the oracle once again<br>
         Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;<br>
         Then there is no blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Those who are uncertain gradually join.<br>
         Whoever come too late<br>
         Meets with misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may
    complement and aid one another through holding together. But such holding
    together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite.
   To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter
   and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit,
 consistency,   and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others
 about him ask   himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone
 attempting the   task without a real calling for it only makes confusion
worse than if no  union at all had taken place.  But when there is a real
rallying point, those  who at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come
in of their own accord.   Late-comers must suffer the consequences, for in
holding together the question   of the right time is also important. Relationships
 are formed and firmly  established according to definite inner laws. Common
 experiences strengthen  these ties, and he who comes too late to share in
 these basic experiences  must suffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds
the door locked.  If a man  has recognized the necessity for union and does
not feel strong enough to  function as the center, it is his duty to become
a member of some other organic  fellowship.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  On the earth is water:<br>
         The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the kings of antiquity<br>
         Bestowed the different states as fiefs<br>
         And cultivated friendly relations<br>
         With the feudal lords.</p>
                         
  <p>  Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to
    it. The social organization of ancient China was based on this principle
   of the holding together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite
with   water, because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too
should   human society hold together through a community of interests that
allows  each individual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central
power of  a social organization must see to it that every member finds that
his true  interest lies in holding together with it, as was the case in the
paternal  relationship between king and vassals in ancient China.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Hold to him in truth and loyalty;<br>
         This is without blame.<br>
         Truth, like a full earthen bowl"<br>
         Thus in the end<br>
         Good fortune comes from without.</p>
                         
  <p>  Fundamental sincerity is the only proper basis for forming relationships.
    This attitude, symbolized by a full earthen bowl, in which the content
 is   everything and the empty form nothing, shows itself not in clever words
  but  through the strength of what lies within the speaker. This strength
 is so  great that it has power to attract good fortune to itself from without.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Hold to him inwardly.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  If a person responds perseveringly and in the right way to the behests
    from above that summon him to action, his relations with others are intrinsic
    and he does not lose himself. But if a man seeks association with others
   as if he were an obsequious office hunter, he throws himself away. He
does    not follow the path of the superior man, who never loses his dignity.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  You hold together with the wrong people.</p>
                         
  <p>  We are often among people who do not belong to our own sphere. In
that case we must beware of being drawn into false intimacy through force
of habit. Needless to say, this would have evil consequences. Maintaining
sociability without intimacy is the only right attitude toward people, because
otherwise we should not be free to enter into relationship with people of
our own kind later on.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Hold to him outwardly also.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the relations with a man who is the center of union are well
established. Then we may, and indeed we should, show our attachment openly.
But we must remain constant and not allow ourselves to be led astray.
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
          Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Manifestation of holding together.<br>
         In the hunt the king uses beaters on three sides only<br>
         And forgoes game that runs off in front.<br>
         The citizens need no warning.<br>
         Good fortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  In the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive up the
    game from three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a chance to
run    off. If they failed to do this they had to pass through a gate behind
which    the king stood ready to shoot. Only animals that entered here were
shot;   those that ran off in front were permitted to escape. This custom
accorded   with a kingly attitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn
the chase into  a slaughter, but held that the kill should consist only of
those animals  which had so to speak voluntarily exposed themselves.   There
is depicted  here a ruler, or influential man, to whom people are attracted.
Those who  come to him he accepts, those who do not come are allowed to go
their own  way. He invited none, flatters none--all come of their own free
will. In this way there develops a voluntary dependence among those who hold
him. They do not have to be constantly on their guard but may express their
opinions     openly. Police measures are not necessary, and they cleave to
their ruler     of their own volition. The same principle of freedom is valid
for life  in   general. We should not woo favor from people. If a man cultivates
within    himself the purity and the strength that are necessary for one
who is the    center of a fellowship, those who are meant for him come of
their own accord.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He finds no head for holding together.<br>
         Misfortune.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  The head is the beginning. If the beginning is not right, there is
    no hope of a right ending. If we have missed the right moment for union
  and  go on hesitating to give complete and full devotion, we shall regret
  the error when it is too late.</p>
