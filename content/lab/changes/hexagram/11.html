<title>䷊  Hexagram 11. T'ai / Peace</title>

  <p>  above  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
         below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                         
  <p>  The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the Creative, which
    moves upward, is below. Hence their influences meet and are in harmony,
  so  that all living things bloom and prosper. This hexagram belongs to
the   first  month (February-March), at which time the forces of nature prepare
  the new  spring. </p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  <br>
         PEACE. The small departs,<br>
         The great approaches.<br>
         Good fortune. Success.</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be on
earth. Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite
in deep harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things.
 In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places
show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds.
  In side, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the
dark principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while
the dark is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good
elements of society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil
elements come under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit
of heaven rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence
and takes its appropriate place.   The individual lines enter the hexagram
from below and leave it again at the top. Here the small, weak, and evil
elements are about to take their departure, while the great, strong, and
good elements are moving up. This brings good fortune and success.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Heaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE.<br>
         Thus the ruler<br>
         Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth,<br>
         And so aids the people.</p>
                         
  <p>  Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing
    a time of universal flowering and prosperity. This stream of energy must
   be regulated by the ruler of men. It is done by a process of division.
Thus   men divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to
the succession    of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the
points of the compass.   In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion
of phenomena is bounded  and controlled. One the other hand, nature must
be furthered in her productiveness.   This is done by adjusting the products
to the right time and the right place,   which increases the natural yield.
 This controlling and furthering activity   of man in his relation to nature
is the work on nature that rewards him.</p>

  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br>
         Each according to his kind.<br>
         Undertakings bring good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of prosperity every able man called to fill an office draws
    like minded people along with him, just as in pulling up ribbon grass
one    always pulls up a bunch of it, because the stalks are connected by
their   roots. In such times, when it is possible to extend influence widely,
the   mind of an able man is set upon going out into life and accomplishing
something.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p> Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>   Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness,<br>
          Fording the river with resolution,<br>
          Not neglecting what is distant,<br>
          Not regarding one's companions:</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus one may manage to walk in the middle.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of prosperity it is important and above all to possess enough
    greatness of soul to bear with imperfect people. For in the hands of
a  great   master no material is unproductive; he can find use for everything.
 But this  generosity is by no means laxity or weakness. It is during times
 of prosperity  especially that we must always be ready to risk even dangerous
  undertakings,  such as the crossing of a river, if they are necessary.
So   too we must not  neglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously
to  everything. Factionalism  and the dominance of cliques are especially
to be avoided. Even if people  of like mind come forward together, they ought
not to form a faction by holding  together for mutual advantage; instead,
each man should do is duty. Theses  are four ways in which one can overcome
the hidden danger of a gradual slackening  that always lurks in any time
of peace. And that is how one finds the middle  way for action.</p>

  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  No plain not followed by a slope.<br>
         No going not followed by a return.<br>
          He who remains persevering in danger<br>
         Is without blame.<br>
         Do not complain about this truth;<br>
         Enjoy the good fortune you still possess.</p>
                         
  <p>  Everything on earth is subject to change. Prosperity is followed by
    decline: this is the eternal law on earth. Evil can indeed be held in
check    but not permanently abolished. It always returns. This conviction
might  induct  melancholy, but it should not; it ought only to keep us from
falling  into  illusion when good fortune comes to us. If we continue mindful
of the  danger,  we remain persevering and make no mistakes. As long as a
man's inner  nature  remains stronger and richer than anything offered by
external fortune,  as  long as he remains inwardly superior to fate, fortune
will not desert  him.</p>

  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He flutters down, not boasting of his wealth,<br>
         Together with his neighbor,<br>
         Guileless and sincere.</p>
                         
  <p>  In times of mutual confidence, people of high rank come in close contact
    with the lowly quite simply and without boasting of their wealth. This
 is   not due to the force of circumstances but corresponds with their inmost
  sentiment.  The approach is made quite spontaneously, because it is based
  on inner conviction.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The sovereign I<br>
         Gives his daughter in marriage.<br>
         And supreme good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. By his decree the imperial
    princesses, although higher in rank than their husbands, had to obey
them     like all other wives. Here too we are shown a truly modest union
of high    and low that brings happiness and blessings.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wall falls back into the moat.<br>
         Use no army now.<br>
         Make your commands known within your own town.<br>
         Perseverance brings humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  The change alluded to in the middle of the hexagram has begun to take
    place. The wall of the town sinks back into the moat from which it was
 dug.   The hour of doom is at hand. When matters have come to this pass,
we should   submit to fate and not try to stave it off by violent resistance.
 The one   recourse left us is to hold our own within our intimate circle.
 Should we   persevere in trying to resist the evil in the usual way, our
collapse would   only be more complete, and humiliation would be the result.</p>
