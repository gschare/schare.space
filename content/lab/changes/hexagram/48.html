<title>䷯  Hexagram 48. Ching / The Well</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
         below SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD</p>
                         
  <p>  Wood is below, water above. The wood goes down into the earth to bring
    up water. The image derives from the pole-and-bucket well of ancient
China.     The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were
made of   clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled
up from the   well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift
water out  of the earth by means of their fibers.  The well from which water
is drawn  conveys the further idea of an inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE WELL. The town may be changed,<br>
         But the well cannot be changed.<br>
         It neither decreases nor increases.</p>
                         
  <p>  They come and go and draw from the well.<br>
         If one gets down almost to the water<br>
         And the rope does not go all the way,<br>
         Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for
    the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties.
    The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the
shape    of the well has remained the same from ancient times to this day.
Thus the   well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by
mankind in  meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political
forms.  Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with
its needs remains eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also
inexhaustible.  It grows neither less not more; it exists for one and for
all. The generations    come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible
abundance.  However,    there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political
or social organization    of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations
of life. For any merely    superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest
needs unsatisfied is   as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever
been made. Carelessness-by    which the jug is broken-is also disastrous.
If for instance the military   defense of a state is carried to such excess
that it provokes wars by which   the power of the state is annihilated, this
is a breaking of the jug.  This   hexagram applies also to the individual.
However men may differ in disposition   and in education, the foundations
of human nature are the same in everyone.   And every human being can draw
in the course of his education from the inexhaustible    wellspring of the
divine in man's nature. But here likewise two dangers  threaten:  a man may
fail in his education to penetrate to the real roots  of humanity  and remain
fixed in convention-a partial education of this sort  is as bad  as none-
or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self-development.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,<br>
         And exhorts them to help one another.</p>
                         
  <p>  The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above
    it. Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the
action    of the well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior
man organizes    human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts
co-operate for   the benefit of the whole.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One does not drink the mud of the well.</p>
                         
  <p>  No animals come to an old well.</p>
                         
  <p>  If a man wanders around in swampy lowlands, his life is submerged
in mud. Such a man loses all significance for mankind. He who throws himself
    away is no longer sought out by others. In the end no one troubles about
   him any more.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  At the well hole one shoots fishes.</p>
                         
  <p>  The jug is broken and leaks.</p>
                         
  <p>  The water itself is clear, but it is not being used. Thus the well
    is a place where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes
only     to catch fish. But the jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be
kept in   it.  This describes the situation of a person who possesses good
qualities    but neglects them. No one bothers about him. As a result he
deteriorates   in mind. He associates with inferior men and can no longer
accomplish anything    worth while.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.</p>
                         
  <p>  This is my heart's sorrow,<br>
         For one might draw from it.<br>
         If the king were clear-minded,<br>
         Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.</p>
                         
  <p>  An able man is available. He is like a purified well whose water is
    drinkable. But no use is made of him. This is the sorrow of those who
know    him. One wishes that the prince might learn about it; this would
be good   fortune for all concerned.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The well is being lined. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  True, if a well is being lined with sone, it cannot be used while
the work is going on. But the work is not in vain; the result is that the
water stays clear. In life also there are times when a man must put himself
in order. During such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is
nonetheless valuable, because by enhancing his powers and abilities through
inner development, he can accomplish all the more later on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  In the well there is a clear, cold spring<br>
         From which one can drink.</p>
                         
  <p>  A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well. A man
    who has virtues like a well of this sort is born to be a leader and savior
    of men, for he has the water of life. Nevertheless, the character for
"good    fortune" is left out here. The all-important thing about a well
is that  its  water be drawn. The best water is only a potentiality for refreshment
  as long as it is not brought up. So too with leaders of mankind: it is
all-important     that one should drink from the spring of their words and
translate them   into  life.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  One draws from the well<br>
         Without hindrance.<br>
         It is dependable.</p>
                         
  <p>  Supreme good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The well is there fore all. No one is forbidden to take water from
    it. No matter how many come, all find what they need, for the well is
dependable.    It has a spring and never runs dry. Therefore it is a great
blessing to  the  whole land. The same is true of the really great man, whose
inner wealth   is inexhaustible; the more that people draw from him, the
greater his wealth    becomes.</p>
