  <p>  above  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
         below  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE</p>
                         
  <p>  Above we have Chên, the eldest son, and below, Tui, the youngest
    daughter. The man leads and the girl follows him in gladness. The picture
    is that of the entrance of the girl into her husband's house. In all,
there    are four hexagrams depicting the relationship between husband and
wife.  <a href="31.html">Hsien,  INFLUENCE</a>, describes the attraction that a
young couple have for each other; <a href="32.html">Hêng, DURATION</a>,
  portrays the permanent relationships of marriage;
  <a href="53.html">Chien, DEVELOPMENT</a>,
  reflects the protracted, ceremonious procedures
    attending THE MARRYING MAIDEN, shows a young girl under the guidance
of   an  older man who marries her.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE MARRYING MAIDEN.<br>
         Undertakings bring misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing that would further.</p>
                         
  <p>  A girl who is taken into the family, but not as the chief wife, must
    behave with special caution and reserve. She must not take it upon herself
    to supplant the mistress of the house, for that would mean disorder and
  lead  to untenable relationships.  The same is true of all voluntary relationships
    between human beings. While legally regulated relationships based on
personal     inclination depend in the long run entirely on tactful reserve.
 Affection     as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest
importance   in  all relationships in the world. For the union of heaven
and earth is  the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise,
spontaneous  affection  is the all-inclusive principle of union.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder over the lake:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE MARRYING MAIDEN.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man<br>
         Understands the transitory<br>
         In the light of the eternity of the end.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in shimmering
    waves. This symbolizes the girl who follows the man of her choice. But
 every   relationship between individuals bears within it the danger that
wrong turns   may be taken, leading to endless misunderstandings and disagreements.
  Therefore   it is necessary constantly to remain mindful of the end. If
we  permit ourselves   to drift along, we come together and are parted again
 as the day may determine.   If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on
an end that endures, he will   succeed in avoiding the reefs that confront
the closer relationships of people.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The marrying maiden as a concubine.<br>
         A lame man who is able to tread.<br>
         Undertakings bring good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The princess of ancient China maintained a fixed order of rank among
    the court ladies, who were subordinated to the queen as are younger sisters
    to the eldest. Frequently they came from the family of the queen, who
herself    led them to her husband.  The meaning is that a girl entering
a family with   the consent of the wife will not rank outwardly as the equal
of the latter   but will withdraw modestly into the background. However,
if she understands   how to fit herself into the pattern of things, her position
 will be entirely   satisfactory, and she will feel sheltered in the love
of the husband to whom  she bears children.  The same meaning is brought
out in the relationships   between officials. A man may enjoy the personal
friendship of a prince and   be taken into his confidence. Outwardly this
man must keep tactfully in the  background behind the official ministers
of state, but, although he is hampered  by this status, as if he were lame,
he can nevertheless accomplish something  through the kindliness of his nature.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-9">
  <p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  A one-eyed man who is able to see.</p>
                         
  <p>  The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here the situation is that of a girl married to a man who has disappointed
    her. Man and wife ought to work together like a pair of eyes. Here the
 girl   is left behind in loneliness; the man of her choice either has become
 unfaithful   or has died. But she does not lost the inner light of loyalty.
 Thought the   other eye is gone, she maintains her loyalty even in loneliness.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The marrying maiden as a slave.</p>
                         
  <p>  She marries as a concubine.</p>
                         
  <p>  A girl who is in a lowly position and finds no husband may, in some
    circumstances, still win shelter as a concubine.  This pictures the situation
    of a person who longs too much for joys that cannot be obtained in the
 usual   way. He enters upon a situation not altogether compatible with self-esteem.
    Neither judgment nor warning is added to this line; it merely lays bare
  the  actual situation, so that everyone may draw a lesson from it.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.<br>
         A late marriage comes in due course.</p>
                         
  <p>  The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself away, and
    allows the customary time for marriage to slip by. However, there is
no   harm  in this; she is rewarded for her purity and, even though belatedly,
  finds  the husband intended for her.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.</p>
                         
  <p>  The embroidered garments of the princess<br>
         Were not as gorgeous<br>
         As those of the serving maid.</p>
                         
  <p>  The moon that is nearly full<br>
         Brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. This ruler decreed that the
    imperial princesses should be subordinated to their husbands in the same
   manner as other women (cf. Hexagram
  <a href="11.html">11</a>, six in the fifth place). The emperor does not
    wait for a suitor to woo his daughter but gives her in marriage when
he   sees  fit. Therefore it is in accord with custom for the girl's family
to   take the initiative here.  We see here a girl of aristocratic birth
who marries   a man of modest circumstances and understands how to adapt
herself with grace   to the new situation. She is free of all vanity of outer
adornment,  and forgetting  her rank in her marriage, takes a place below
that of her  husband, just as  the moon, before it is quite full, does not
directly face  the sun.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it.</p>
                         
  <p>  The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing that acts to further.</p>
                         
  <p>  At the sacrifice to the ancestors, the woman had to present harvest
    offerings in a basket, while the man slaughtered the sacrificial animal
  with  his own hand. Here the ritual is only superficially fulfilled; the
 woman takes an empty basket and the man stabs a sheep slaughtered beforehand-solely
   to preserve the forms. This impious, irreverent attitude bodes no good
for   a marriage.</p>
