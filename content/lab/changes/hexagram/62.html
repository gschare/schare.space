<title>䷽  Hexagram 62. Hsiao Kuo / Preponderance of the Small</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
         below KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  While in the hexagram <a href="28.html">Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT</a>, the strong lines preponderate and are within,
    inclosed between weak lines at the top and bottom, the present hexagram
  has  weak lines preponderating, though here again they are on the outside,
  the  strong lines being within. This indeed is the basis of the exceptional
  situation  indicated by the hexagram. When strong lines are outside, we
  have  the hexagram  <a href="27.html">I, PROVIDING NOURISHMENT</a>,
  or <a href="61.html">Chung Fu, INNER TRUTH</a>; neither represents and exceptional state. When
    strong elements within preponderate, they necessarily enforce their will.
    This creates struggle and exceptional conditions in general. But in the
  present  hexagram it is the weak element that perforce must mediate with
 the outside  world. If a man occupies a position of authority for which
he  is by nature  really inadequate, extraordinary prudence is necessary.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Success.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  Small things may be done; great things should not be done.</p>
                         
  <p>  The flying bird brings the message:<br>
         It is not well to strive upward,<br>
         It is well to remain below.<br>
         Great good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Exceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be rewarded
with success; however, if a man is not to throw himself away, it is important
that they should not become empty form and subservience but be combined always
    with a correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the demands
    of the time in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies
 and   damages. In any event we must not count on great success, since the
 requisite   strength is lacking. In this lies the importance of the message
 that one  should not strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things.
 The structure  of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message
 is brought by a bird. In <a href="28.html">Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT</a>,
  the four strong, heavy lines within, supported
    only by two weak lines without, give the image of a sagging ridgepole.
 Here   the supporting weak lines are both outside and preponderant; this
gives the  image of a soaring bird. But a bird should not try to surpass
itself and fly into the sun; it should descend to the earth, where its nest
is. In this way it gives the message conveyed by the hexagram.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Thunder on the mountain:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.<br>
         In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.<br>
         In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain. In
    the mountains, thunder seems much nearer; outside the mountains, it is
 less   audible than the thunder of an ordinary storm. Thus the superior
man  derives   an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes
more  closely and  more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even
though  this might  make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He
is exceptionally  conscientious   in his actions. In bereavement emotion
means more to him than ceremoniousness.   In all his personal expenditures
he is extremely simple and unpretentious.   In comparison with the man of
the masses, all this makes him stand out as   exceptional. But the essential
significance of his attitude lies in the fact  that in external matters he
is on the side of the lowly.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The bird meets with misfortune through flying.</p>
                         
  <p>  A bird ought to remain in the nest until it is fledged. If it tries
    to fly before this, it invites misfortune. Extraordinary measures should
   be resorted to only when all else fails. At first we ought to put up with
   traditional ways as long as possible; otherwise we exhaust ourselves and
  our energy and still achieve nothing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  She passes by her ancestor<br>
         And meets her ancestress.<br>
         He does not reach his prince<br>
         And meets the official.</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Two exceptional situations are instanced here. In the temple of ancestors,
    where alternation of generations prevails, the grandson stands on the
same    side as the grandfather. Hence his closest relations are with the
grandfather.    The present line designates the grandson's wife, who during
the sacrifice    passes by the ancestor and goes toward the ancestress. This
unusual behavior    is, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures
rather to approach    the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their
common sex. Hence  here  deviation from the rule is not a mistake.  Another
image is that of  the official  who, in compliance with regulation, first
seeks an audience  with his prince.  If he is not successful in this, he
does not try to force  anything but goes  about conscientious fulfillment
of his duty, taking his  place among the other  officials. This extraordinary
restraint is likewise  not a mistake in exceptional  times. (The rule is
that every official should  first have an audience with  the prince by whom
he is appointed. Here the  appointment is made by the minister.)</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If one is not extremely careful,</p>
                         
  <p>  Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>   At certain times extraordinary caution is absolutely necessary. But
    it is just in such life situations that we find upright and strong personalities
    who, conscious of being in the right, disdain to hold themselves on guard,
    because they consider it petty. Instead, they go their way proud and
unconcerned.     But this self-confidence deludes them. There are dangers
lurking for which     they are unprepared. Yet such danger is not unavoidable;
one can escape   it  if he understands that the time demands that he pay
especial attention   to  small and insignificant thing.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  No blame. He meets him without passing by.<br>
         Going brings danger. One must be on guard.<br>
         Do not act. Be constantly persevering.</p>
                         
  <p>  Hardness of character is tempered by yielding position so that no
mistakes are made. The situation here calls for extreme caution; one must
make no attempt of one's own initiative to reach the desired end. And if
one were to go on, endeavoring one must be on guard and not act but continue
inwardly to persevere.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p> Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Dense clouds,</p>
                         
  <p>  No rain from our western territory.</p>
                         
  <p>  The prince shoots and hits him who is in the cave.</p>
                         
  <p>  As a high place is pictured here, the image of a flying bird has become
    that of flying clouds. But dense as the clouds are, they race across
the    sky and give no rain. Similarly, in exceptional times there may be
a born    ruler who is qualified to set the world in order, but who cannot
achieve   anything or confer blessing on the people because he stands alone
and has   no helpers. Is such times a man must seek out helpers with whose
aid he can  carry out the task. But these helpers must be modestly sought
out in the retirement to which they have withdrawn. It is not in the fame
nor their great names but their genuine achievements that are important.
Through such modesty the right man is found, and the exceptional task is
carried out in spite of all difficulties.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-6">
  <p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He passes him by, not meeting him.</p>
                         
  <p>  The flying bird leaves him.<br>
         Misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This means bad luck and injury.</p>
                         
  <p>  If one overshoots the goal, one cannot hit it. If a bird will not
come to its nest but flies higher and higher, it eventually falls into the
hunter's net. He who in times of extraordinary salience of small things does
not know how to call a halt, but restlessly seeks to press on and on, draws
upon himself misfortune at the hands of gods and men, because he deviates
from the order of nature.</p>
