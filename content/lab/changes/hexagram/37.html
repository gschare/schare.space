  <p>  above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND<br>
         below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                         
  <p>  The hexagram represents the laws obtaining within the family. The
strong line at the top represents the father, the lowest the son. The strong
line in the fifth place represents the husband, the yielding second line
the wife. On the other hand, the two strong lines in the fifth and the third
place represent two brothers, and the two weak lines correlated with them
in the fourth and the second place stand for their respective wives. Thus
all the connections and relationships within the family find their appropriate
expression. Each individual line has the character according with its place.
The fact that a strong line occupies the sixth place-where a weak line might
be expected-indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come from
the head of the family. The line is to be considered here not in its quality
as the sixth but in its quality as the top line. THE FAMILY shows the laws
operative within the household that, transferred to outside life, keep the
state and the world in order. The influence that goes out from within the
family is represented by the symbol of the wind created by fire.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  THE FAMILY. The perseverance of the woman furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  The foundation of the family is the relationship between husband and
    wife. The tie that hold the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance
    of the wife. The tie that holds the family together lies in the loyalty
  and  perseverance of the wife. Her place is within (second line), while
that  of  the husband is without (fifth line). It is in accord with the great
laws   of nature that husband and wife take their proper places. Within the
family   a strong authority is needed; this is represented by the parents.
If the  father is really a father and the son a son, if the elder brother
fulfills  his position, and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really
a husband  and the wife a wife, then the family is in order. When the family
is in order,  all the social relationships of mankind will be in order. 
Three of the five  social relationships are to be found within the family-that
between father  and son, which is the relation of love, that between the
husband and wife,  which is the relation of chaste conduct, and that between
elder and younger  brother, which is the relation of correctness. The loving
reverence of the  son is then carried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness
 to duty;  the affection and correctness of behavior existing between the
two brothers  are extended to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person
 of superior  rank in the form of deference. The family is society in the
embryo; it is  the native soil on which performance of moral duty is made
early through natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of
moral practice is created, and this is later widened to include human relationships
in general.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Wind comes forth from fire:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of THE FAMILY.Thus the superior man has substance in his
    words<br>
         And duration in his way of life.</p>
                         
  <p>  Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the
    fire and issuing forth form it. This represents influence working from
 within   outward. The same thing is needed in the regulation of the family.
 Here too  the influence on others must proceed form one's own person. In
order to be  capable of producing such an influence, one's words must have
power, and this they can have only if they are based on something real, just
as flame depends on its fuel Words have influence only when they are pertinent
  and clearly related to definite circumstances. General discourses and admonitions
   have no effect whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by
one's   entire conduct, just as the wind is made effective by am impression
on others   that they can adapt and conform to it. If words and conduct are
not in accord   and consistent, they will have no effect.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Firm seclusion within the family.<br>
         Remorse disappears.</p>
                         
  <p>  The family must form a well-defined unit within which each member
knows his place. From the beginning each child must be accustomed to firmly
established rules of order, before ever its will is directed to other things.
If we begin too late to enforce order, when the will of the child has already
been overindulged, the whims and passions, grown stronger with the years,
offer resistance and give cause for remorse. If we insist on order from the
outset, occasions for remorse may arise-in general social life these are
unavoidable-but the remorse always disappears again, and everything rights
itself. For there is nothing easily avoided and more difficult to carry through
than "breaking a child's will."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  She should not follow her whims.</p>
                         
  <p>  She must attend within to the food.<br>
         Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The wife must always be guided by the will of the master of the house,
    be he father, husband, or grown son. There, without having to look for
 them,   she has great and important duties.  She must attend to the nourishment
  of  her family and to the food for the sacrifice. IN this way she becomes
  the  center of the social and religious life of the family, and her perseverance
    in this position brings good fortune to the whole house.   In relation
 to   general conditions, the counsel here is to seek nothing by means of
force,   but quietly to confine oneself to the duties at hand.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  When tempers flare up in the family,</p>
                         
  <p>  Too great severity brings remorse.<br>
         Good fortune nonetheless.<br>
         When woman and chile dally and laugh<br>
         It leads in the end to humiliation.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the family the proper mean between severity and indulgence ought
    to prevail. Too great severity toward one's own flesh and blood leads
to   remorse. The wise thing is to build strong dikes within which complete
freedom   of movement is allowed each individual. But in doubtful instances
too great   severity, despite occasional mistakes, is preferable, because
it preserves   discipline in the family, whereas too great weakness leads
to disgrace.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  She is the treasure of the house.<br>
         Great good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  It is upon the woman of the house that the well-being of the family
    depends. Well-being prevails when expenditures and income are soundly
balanced.    This leads to great good fortune. In the sphere of public life,
this line    refers to the faithful steward whose measures further the general
welfare.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  As a king he approaches his family.<br>
         Fear not.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A king is the symbol of a fatherly man who is richly endowed in mind.
    He does nothing to make himself feared; on the contrary, the whole family
    can trust him, because love governs their intercourse. His character
of   itself  exercises the right influence.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  His work commands respect.'<br>
         In the end good fortune comes.</p>
                         
  <p>  In the last analysis, order within the family depends on the character
    of the master of the house. If he cultivates his personality so that
it   works  impressively through the force of inner truth, all goes well
with  the family.  In a ruling position one must of his own accord assume
responsibility.</p>
