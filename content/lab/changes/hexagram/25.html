<h1>䷘  Hexagram 25. Wu Wang / Innocence (The Unexpected)</h1>
<title>䷘  Hexagram 25. Wu Wang / Innocence (The Unexpected)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>
<p><a href="/lab/changes/" id="back">Back to casting</a></p>
                         
  <p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
         below  CHêN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                         
  <p>  Ch'ien, heaven is above; Chên, movement, is below. The lower
    trigram Chên is under the influence of the strong line it has received
    form above, from heaven. When, in accord with this, movement follows
the    law of heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural
and    true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious
   purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been
  lost. Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate
  nature. Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought
in  part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea
of  the fundamental or unexpected.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  INNOCENCE. Supreme success.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.<br>
         If someone is not as he should be,<br>
         He has misfortune,<br>
         And it does not further him<br>
         To undertake anything.</p>
                         
  <p>  Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him
in all his movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he
attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive
sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage.
This instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through
perseverance". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher
sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will
of heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive
way of acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who
departs from innocence, what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing
do not go with his deeds."</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Under heaven thunder rolls:<br>
         All things attain the natural state of innocence.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the kings of old,<br>
         Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,<br>
         Fostered and nourished all beings.</p>
                         
  <p>  In springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under
    the heavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive for
the    creative activity of nature the childlike innocence of their original
state.    So it is with the good rulers of mankind: drawing on the spiritual
wealth    at their command, they take care of all forms of life and all forms
of culture   and do everything to further them, and at the proper time.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>   Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Innocent behavior brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The original impulses of the heart are always good, so that we may
    follow them confidently, assured of good fortune and achievement of our
  aims.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  If one does not count on the harvest while plowing,</p>
                         
  <p>  Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,<br>
         It furthers one to undertake something.</p>
                         
  <p>  We should do every task for its own sake as time and place demand
and not with an eye to the result. Then each task turns out well, and anything
    we undertake succeeds.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-6">
  <p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Undeserved misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The cow that was tethered by someone<br>
         Is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.</p>
                         
  <p>  Sometimes undeserved misfortune befalls a man at the hands of another,
    as for instance when someone passes by and takes a tethered cow along
with    him. His gain is the owner's loss. In all transactions, no matter
how innocent,    we must accommodate ourselves to the demands of the time,
otherwise unexpected    misfortune overtakes us.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-9">
  <p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He who can be persevering <br>
         Remains without blame.<br>
         </p>
                         
  <p>  We cannot lose what really belongs to us, even if we throw it away.
    Therefore we need have no anxiety. All that need concern us is that we
 should   remain true to our own natures and not listen to others.<br>
          Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Use no medicine in an illness<br>
         Incurred through no fault of your own.<br>
         It will pass of itself.</p>
                         
  <p>  An unexpected evil may come accidentally from without. If it does
not originate in one's own nature or have a foothold there, one should not
resort to external means to eradicate it, but should quietly let nature take
its course. Then improvement will come of itself.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Innocent action brings misfortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Nothing furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  When, in a given situation, the time is not ripe for further progress,
    the best thing to do is to wait quietly, without ulterior designs. If
one    acts thoughtlessly and tries to push ahead in opposition to fate,
success    will not be achieved.</p>
