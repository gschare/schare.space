<title>䷕  Hexagram 22. Pi / Grace</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>

  <p>  above  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
         below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of
    the earth and, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the
  heavenly  heights. Grace-beauty of form-is necessary in any union if it
is  to be well  ordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  GRACE has success.<br>
         In small matters<br>
         It is favorable to undertake something.</p>
                         
  <p>  Grace brings success. However, it is not the essential or fundamental
    thing; it is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only
  in  little things. In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between
    two strong lines and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the
  essential  content and the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper
  trigram of  the mountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here
again   the strong  element must be regarded as the decisive factor. In nature
we   see in the sky the strong light of the sun; the life of the world depends
  on it. But this strong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety
   by the moon and the stars. In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into
being   when traditions exist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are
made pleasing  by a lucid beauty. By contemplating the forms existing in
the heavens we come to understand time and its changing demands. Through
contemplation of the forms existing in human society it becomes possible
to shape the world.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  Fire at the foot of the mountain:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of GRACE.<br>
         Thus does the superior man proceed <br>
         When clearing up current affairs.<br>
         But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.</p>
                         
  <p>  The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing,
    does not shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten
   and to throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions
   cannot be decided in this way. They require greater earnestness.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-9">
  <p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage, and walks.</p>
                         
  <p>  A beginner in subordinate place must take upon himself the labor of
    advancing. There might be an opportunity of surreptitiously easing the
 way-symbolized   by the carriage-but a self-contained man scorns help gained
 in a dubious  fashion. He thinks it more graceful to go on foot than to
drive  in a carriage  under false pretenses.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Lends grace to the beard on his chin.</p>
                         
  <p>  The beard is not an independent thing; it moves only with the chin.
    The image therefore means that form is to be considered only as a result
   and attribute of content. The beard is a superfluous ornament. To devote
  care to it for its own sake, without regard for the inner content of which
  it is an ornament, would bespeak a certain vanity.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Graceful and moist.<br>
         Constant perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  This represents a very charming life situation. One is under the spell
    of grace and the mellow mood induced by wine. This grace can adorn, but
  it  can also swamp us. Hence the warning not to sink into convivial indolence
    but to remain constant in perseverance. Good fortune depends on this.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Grace or simplicity?<br>
         A white horse comes as if on wings.<br>
         He is not a robber,<br>
         He will woo at the right time.</p>
                         
  <p>  An individual is in a situation in which doubts arise as to which
is better-to pursue the grace of external brilliance, or to return to simplicity.
    The doubt itself implies the answer. Confirmation comes from the outside;
    it comes like a white winged horse. The white color indicates simplicity.
    At first it may be disappointing to renounce the comforts that might
have     been obtained, yet one finds peace of mind in a true relationship
with  the   friend who courts him. The winged horse is the symbol of the
thoughts  that   transcend all limits of space and time.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj5-6">
  <p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Grace in the hills and gardens.<br>
         The roll of silk is meager and small.<br>
         Humiliation, but in the end good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  A man withdraws from contact with people of the lowlands, who seek
    nothing but magnificence and luxury, in to the solitude of the heights.
  There  he finds an individual to look up to, whom he would like to have
as  a friend.  But the gifts he has to offer are poor and few, so that he
feels  ashamed.  However, it is not the material gifts that count, but sincerity
  of feeling,  and so all goes well in the end.</p>

  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p> Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  Simple grace. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here at the highest stage of development all ornament is discarded.
    Form no longer conceals content but brings out its value to the full.
Perfect    grace consists not in exterior ornamentation of the substance,
but in the    simple fitness of its form.</p>
