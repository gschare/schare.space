<title>䷴  Hexagram 53. Chien / Development (Gradual Progress)</title>
<p id="alternative"></p>

  <p>  above  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD<br>
         below  KêN  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                         
  <p>  This hexagram is made up of Sun (wood, penetration) above, i.e., without,
    and Kên (mountain, stillness) below, i.e., within. A tree on a
mountain     develops slowly according to the law of its being and consequently
stands     firmly rooted. This gives the idea of a development that proceeds
gradually,     step by step. The attributes of the trigrams also point to
this: within   is  tranquillity, which guards against precipitate actions,
and without is  penetration,  which makes development and progress possible.</p>
                         
  <h2>Judgment</h2>
                         
  <p>  DEVELOPMENT. The maiden<br>
         Is given in marriage.<br>
         Good fortune.<br>
         Perseverance furthers.</p>
                         
  <p>  The development of events that leads to a girl's following a man to
    his home proceeds slowly. The various formalities must be disposed of
before    the marriage takes place. This principle of gradual development
can be applied   to other situations as well; it is always applicable where
it is a matter   of correct relationships of co-operation, as for instance
in the appointment   of an official. The development must be allowed to take
its proper course.   Hasty action would not be wise. This is also true, finally,
 of any effort   to exert influence on others, for here too the essential
factor is a correct   way of development through cultivation of one's own
personality. No influence   such as that exerted by agitators has a lasting
effect.  Within the personality   too, development must follow the same course
if lasting results are to be   achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but
at the same time penetrating,   is the outer form that should proceed from
inner calm.  The very gradualness   of the development makes it necessary
to have perseverance, for perseverance   alone prevents slow progress from
dwindling to nothing.</p>
                         
  <h2>Image</h2>
                         
  <p>  On the mountain, a tree:</p>
                         
  <p>  The image of DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                         
  <p>  Thus the superior man abides in dignity and virtue,<br>
         In order to improve the mores.</p>
                         
  <p>  The tree on the mountain is visible from afar, and its development
    influences the landscape of the entire region. It does not shoot up like
   a swamp plant; its growth proceeds gradually. Thus also the work of influencing
    people can be only gradual. No sudden influence or awakening is of lasting
    effect. Progress must be quite gradual, and in order to obtain such progress
    in public opinion and in the mores of the people, it is necessary for
the    personality to acquire influence and weight. This comes about through
careful    and constant work on one's own moral development.</p>

  <h2>Lines</h2>
                         
  <div class="lj lj1-6">
  <p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wild goose gradually draws near the shore. </p>
                         
  <p>  The young son is in danger.</p>
                         
  <p>  There is talk. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  All the individual lines in this hexagram symbolize the gradual flight
    of the wild goose. The wild goose is the symbol of conjugal fidelity,
because    it is believed that this bird never takes another mate after the
death of   the first.  The initial line suggests the first resting place
in the flight   of water birds from the water to the heights. The shore is
reached. The situation  is that of a lonely young man who is just starting
out to make his way in  life. Since no one comes to help him, his first steps
are slow and hesitant,  and he is surrounded by danger. Naturally he is subjected
 to much criticism.  But these very difficulties keep him from being too
hasty,   and his progress  is successful.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj2-6">
  <p> Six in the second place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff.<br>
         Eating and drinking in peace and concord.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The cliff is a safe place on shore. The development has gone a step
    further. The initial insecurity has been overcome, and a safe position
 in   life has been found, giving one enough to live on. This first success,
 opening   up a path to activity, brings a certain joyousness of mood, and
 one goes  to meet the future reassured.  It is said of the wild goose that
 it calls  to its comrades whenever it finds food; this is the symbol of
peace  and concord   in good fortune. A man does not want to keep his good
luck for himself only,   but is ready to share it with others.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj3-9">
  <p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wild goose gradually draws near the plateau.</p>
                         
  <p>  The man goes forth and does not return.</p>
                         
  <p>  The woman carries a child but does not bring it forth.<br>
         Misfortune. <br>
         It furthers one to fight off robbers.</p>
                         
  <p>  The high plateau is dry and unsuitable for the wild goose. If it goes
    there, it has lost its way and gone too far. This is contrary to the
law    of development.  It is the same in human life. If we do not let things
develop    quietly but plunge of our own choice too rashly into a struggle,
misfortune    results. A man jeopardizes his own life, and his family perishes
thereby.    However, this is not all necessary; it is only the result of
transgressing    the law of natural development. If one does not willfully
provoke a conflict,    but confines himself to vigorously maintaining his
own position and to warding   off unjustified attacks, all goes well.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj4-6">
  <p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wild goose goes gradually draws near the tree.<br>
         Perhaps it will find a flat branch. No blame.</p>
                         
  <p>  A tree is not a suitable place for a wild goose. But if it is clever,
    it will find a flat branch on which it can get a footing. A man's life
 too,   in the course of its development, often brings him into inappropriate
 situations,   in which he finds it difficult to hold his own without danger.
 Then it is   important to be sensible and yielding. This enables him to
discover  a safe   place in which life can go on, although he may be surrounded
by danger.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="lj lj5-9">
  <p> Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wild goose gradually draws near the summit.<br>
         For three years the woman has no child.<br>
         In the end nothing can hinder her.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  The summit is a high place. In a high position one easily becomes
isolated. One is misjudged by the very person on whom one is dependent-the
woman by her husband, the official by his superior. This is the work of deceitful
persons who have wormed their way in. The result is that relationships remain
sterile, and nothing is accomplished. But in the course of further development,
such misunderstandings are cleared away, and reconciliation is achieved after
all.</p>
  </div>
                         
  <div class="lj lj6-9">
  <p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                         
  <p>  The wild goose gradually draws near the clouds heights.<br>
         Its feathers can be used for the sacred dance.<br>
         Good fortune.</p>
                         
  <p>  Here life comes to its end. A man's work stands completed. The path
    rises high toward heaven, like the flight of wild geese when they have
 left   the earth far behind. There they fly, keeping to the order of their
 flight   in strict formation. And if their feathers fall, they can serve
as ornaments   in the sacred dance pantomimes performed in the temples. Thus
 the life of   a man who has perfected himself is a bright light for the
people  of earth,   who look up to him as an example.</p>
