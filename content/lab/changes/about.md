# About the _I Ching_
<title>About the I Ching</title>

I am writing this quickly because I have to go to a party. Forgive the brief
and frantic tone. I want to expand on this later.

The [_I Ching_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) is a divination method
involving flipping coins to receive a "hexagram" with special interpretations
depending on details of the coin flips. The method does not tell the future,
your fortune, or predict outcomes as such; instead, you should _consult_ the _I
Ching_ regarding a course of action you are planning to take and it will advise
you on whether you will be successful and how to be successful.

Like all major texts there are many translations of the _I Ching_; I am using
here an old one laden with numerous shortcomings but which was nevertheless
easily accessible to me when I made this tool. The tool is independent of the
translation; one could use my software alongside one's preferred translation so
long as it is marked up correctly.

Lastly, a remark about the design.

I believe that the point of making software is to study/meditate on your
subject. It's a way of understanding, just like painting, poetry, or music.
Simone Weil said this, probably.

But like any art, software also requires active choices on the part of the
artist. As poetic form is concerned with vocabulary, meter, prosody,
enjambment, etc., the form of software involves circumscribing the ways people
can interact with the digital artifact. I intentionally made certain choices in
the interaction design, like not having a "reset" button because I want to
discourage users from trying again if they don't like their casting.
