The suburbanization of the corporate office was manifested through three distinct typologies, the office park, the corporate campus, and the corporate estate.

    TCS Hall. My desk resided in room 221B (baker st?). One wall was
green. I opened the window and let in the still hot summer air and stared at
church spires.

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p><strong>
long live the university office</strong></p>

<h2 id="office-relationships">Office Relationships</h2>
<h3>1. Internship Season</h3>

<p>The office contains us. Multitudes within us, within the office. The office is
site witness to full gamut of human emotions. Office happy, office sad, office
wintry february january drudgery&mdash;
    <br>
and&mdash;
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 4em;"><strong>internship summer</strong></p>

<p>The office has never looked more inviting.</p>

<h3 id="the-train">2. The Train</h3>
<p>Employee handbook says it is best to take the train to the office.
Studies show that workplace performance is highest when you board the
last car on an elevated track and watch the wake the rails make. Don’t
resist the bouncing of the train.</p>

<p>You take the 9:42 Shady Grove bound <span style="color: red">Red
Line</span>&mdash;you know, the one that forms a <code>U</code>&mdash;transfer
to the <span style="color: green">Green Line</span> towards Greenbelt
(apt) at Fort Totten, get off at College Park U of Md and wait for the
bus at the station and then another bus to LPS right next to the 4H; get
off on the side of the road once you’re on Greenmead.</p>

<p>What did you read on the way? Was it <em>The Atlantic</em>? You can
do better than that.</p>

<h3 id="comedy">3. Comedy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lampoon the office</li>
<li>It is the only way to acknowledge the central role it plays in your
life
<ul>
<li>When Dilbert burns down the office, the spectacle is comparable to
blowing up the Death Star or <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758732/">Beaufort</a>
<ul>
<li>The office itself, not the manager, is the villain</li>
<li>A building is a character</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Comedy elevates our own experience in life to melodrama which more
closely approximates our emotional subjectivity
<ul>
<li>Comedy is more dramatic than drama</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Someone’s got a case of the Mondays</li>
<li>Are you brave enough to tell your therapist how much you love going
to the office?</li>
<li>How many more offices do you hope to live in throughout your
life?</li>
<li>You say so much with a space.</li>
</ul>
