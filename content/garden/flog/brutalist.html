I honestly didn’t love The Brutalist
</title>
<p>I like to watch movies without any context or information. Not even a
log line. A recommendation suffices, or in this case, a stunning
trailer. I saw <em>The Brutalist</em> (2024), dir. Brady Corbet at the
Coolidge Corner Theater in 70mm. I have some complaints.</p>
<p><span class="warning"><strong>Beware!</strong> I’m about to spoil the
entire movie.</span></p>

<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-1%20.test">Complaint No. 1</a></h2>
<p>As a kid I read <a
href="https://www.shauntan.net/arrival-book"><em>The Arrival</em> by
Shaun Tan</a>. In the climax of <em>The Brutalist</em>’s overture, when
László emerges from a dark labyrinth to reveal he is on a ship arriving
at Ellis Island, my mind went to Tan’s fantastical, disorienting
portrayal of an abstracted immigrant experience. The parallels to my own
family’s arrival in America—Eastern European Jews fleeing antisemitism,
albeit in an earlier wave of immigration—left me shivering in
anticipation of what I was sure would be a transcendent epic about a
violent collision of worlds, the transition from the world of separated
families and uncertainty and letters and ships into the world of the
postwar, a world indelibly marked by grim confrontation with the fact
that the turn of the century’s optimism and fervor of progress had given
way to all manner of barbaric ideologies and atrocities in the first
half of the 20th century. I submit my first complaint: that in my
excitement, I misled myself; that this is not what <em>The
Brutalist</em> is about.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-2" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-2">Complaint No. 2</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d7yU379Ur0">The trailer</a>
blew my mind when I saw it in the cinema. It was epic, opaque. The score
promised everything. I submit my second complaint: having seen the
movie, the trailer holds no more mysteries for me.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-3" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-3">Complaint No. 3</a></h2>
<p>So the film continues; the immigrant narrative unfolds, characterized
by unending difficulties and enduring optimism. László finds his
footing, falters, and we find him shoveling coal at the port, and then
Harrison Van Buren comes back and takes over the story and neither
László nor the audience ever escape his gravitational pull.</p>
<p>I guess I am just not terribly interested in diving into the perverse
psychology of American nouveau riche barons. This is a cultural
fascination we seem to have that feels so far removed from anything
common and mundane—from anything actually interesting.</p>
<p>This film could have dared to go big; instead it goes small. Invites
us to New York City and Philadelphia, to the story of the everyman <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> immigrant, and then spirits us away
to a parochial town where the sole focus is this one dude’s oedipal
complex.</p>
<p>I submit, as my third complaint, <em>The Brutalist</em>’s inexcusable
narrowness.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-4" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-4">Complaint No. 4</a></h2>
<p>I submit the fourth and principal complaint: that there was far too
much Harrison Van Buren.</p>
<p>Once drawn in, the film seems to stop caring about anything else and
we only get Harrison. László escapes to New York for all of about one
minute. We see Harrison’s lawyer sent to retrieve him before we see
László himself. That brief scene starts and ends with the sense of
inevitability that László shall return to Doylestown. He doesn’t get a
choice. And the audience is put in Harrison’s predatory vision as we
locate László to bring him back; we don’t get a choice about that
either.</p>
<p>Some more stuff happens. I have ceased to care.</p>
<p>Then Harrison vanishes and we get the most visually striking sequence
of the film, a search through the brutalist (oh!) labyrinth that László
has erected, to mark Harrison’s departure. Too bad it was proceeded only
by the epilogue and credits.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-5" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-5">Complaint No. 5</a></h2>
<p>On that “more stuff” I mentioned—a considerable chunk of it is the
dreamlike Italy sequence. Brady was worried we wouldn’t understand the
Theme, so he kindly clobbered us over the head: don’t you get it!</p>
<p>But that is not my complaint. My complaint is this: that once again
the audience takes on not the perspective of László, for whom the
Carraran quarry would be familiar if not comforting, but the
perspective, again, of Harrison, to whom Italy is a mysterious and
foreign land, where reality and dreams blend and nothing counts. What
happened to the immigrant story? This is now a film about the psychology
of American Industrial Magnate Stereotype No. 14. László’s struggles are
an afterthought. He shoots up off-screen.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-6" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-6">Complaint No. 6</a></h2>
<p>The only scene in the film’s second half that promises some actual
development for László and Erzsébet is when their niece announces she
will make aliyah to the newly founded State of Israel. The couple
struggle to accept the news. They are loath to abandon all they’ve
worked to build in America, even if Israel purports to be a place where
Jews can finally live somewhere they would not be permanently
othered.</p>
<p>And then the matter is dropped except for a perfunctory remark at the
end, and the film basically ends without returning to the thematic meat
of this question. I submit that as my sixth complaint.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-7" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-7">Complaint No. 7</a></h2>
<p>In a movie like this, accidents don’t happen. Someone, either a
producer or Mona Fastvold or Brady Corbet had to be like, “hey, about
this ending…” and they decided to KEEP IT. It is baffling.</p>
<p>One of the minor conflicts in the film is László’s insistence on the
height of the rooms in his plan for the building. Harrison’s team wants
to save on costs. László preciously defends his artistic vision.
Finally, the epilogue reveals that he was insistent on this detail
because each chamber has the same dimensions as the rooms in the
concentration camp he was sent to in the Holocaust, only with much
higher ceilings as a poignant, poetic comment on the freedom of the
spirit or something like that.</p>
<p>I cannot believe they made this the punchline for the entire
movie.</p>
<p>Not to be a script doctor, but could they not have inserted this
remark when László and Erzsébet discuss, in private, <em>in front of his
actual blueprints for the building</em>, the personal sacrifices they
are taking on to support his artistic vision? It almost feels as though
this scene was originally intended as a vessel for this information, but
it was moved to this strange, artificial epilogue, where it can have no
bearing on our direct experience with László’s story. I have no problem
with epilogues, but this choice is downright mystifying.</p>
<p>Complaint number seven is for poor writing.</p>
</section>
<section id="complaint-no.-8" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#complaint-no.-8">Complaint No. 8</a></h2>
<p>Other people don’t seem to appreciate the 80s synth arrangement of
the main theme as much as I do. I submit, for my final complaint, that
they are wrong and need to learn respect for genius artistic vision.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I returned home and opened Stefan Zweig’s memoir, <em>The World of
Yesterday</em>, and found the story I was looking for.</p>
<p>As for <em>The Brutalist</em>… I don’t love it. But I might grow
to.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t, I cannot know the meaning and significance of this
film—or any film—immediately after watching it. Not to mention Susan
Sontag’s invective against interpretation which hangs—for better or
worse—in the back of my mind during any artistic experience. I spoke a
bit about form. I spoke about primary experience. I hope I conveyed with
loving description those few moments of the film that struck me. Now I
go on with my life, and I will not forget <em>The Brutalist</em>,
because it is not forgettable; I felt its impact. In two or three
months, it will come to me again, and then it will mean something else
to me.</p>
