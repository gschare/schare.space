    <p>I wander the pages. I rake the margins. I reach out a hand to feel the
    box layout of a delicate div. I see a misaligned figure, and I put it back
    in its place.</p>

I'm stealing the term <i>garden</i> from
<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton</a>,
but I think of it differently. There are two roles in a garden: the gardener,
and the visitor. The gardener spends their time tending to their garden
spaces, maintaining it. The visitor wanders the garden paths, appreciating the
beauty.

This "garden" is public, but not like
<a href="https://www.boston.gov/parks/public-garden">Boston Public Garden</a> is public.
You can't trample my flowers. It's more like this: I allow you to peer over the fence
and see what I've planted in my proverbial front yard. Anyone can look, but no
one&mdash;except me&mdash;can touch.

What if digital gardens were more like public parks? Shared space, designed for
leisure, free for all, managed as a community, the product of an egalitarian
ethos of digital urbanism. I'd like to participate in an internet that is
more like Brooklyn's <a href="https://www.prospectpark.org/">Prospect Park</a>.

Websites already have something unique going for them. While I have total
despotic control over my website, you can always view the source, download it,
copy it, use it to your own ends. In what other public garden can you pick a
flower and take it home?
