<p>
    A <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital garden</a>
    is loaded metaphor. It evokes a "gardener" who spends their
    leisure time tending to their digital spaces by maintaining and
    updating personal websites, notes, projects, ....
</p>

<p> In another sense, the "garden" itself is a public digital space
where visitors can wander through a hypermedia graph without a
specific goal or designated "correct" path. Visitors can relax and
breathe deeply, because this is not a space that expects anything
of you. The seeds in the garden are simply there so that others can
watch them grow.  </p>

<p> It is <i>not</i> a blog, portfolio, book, catalogue, or archive
(though I do like those things).  It <i>is</i> a celebration and
appreciation of virtual space.  </p>

<p>If anything, it is most similar to a wiki.
Hypertext is central to my conception of the digital
garden.</p>

<p> My garden is eclectic. You may find experiments, half-finished
ideas, and poetry. You may find dead-ends and loops. You may
find context or you may not. You may come back another day and
find things have shifted, appeared, or disappeared. </p>
