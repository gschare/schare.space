<p>A familiar picture: a man (a “nerdy” man), late teens or early 20s,
grew up playing video games on his computer. He’s tech savvy. He’s
intellectually sophisticated enough to consider video games an art
form—or if not that, then a worthwhile medium of entertainment. Video
games, he thinks, obey the same rules as movies: most content released
is drivel, but a precious few are genuine cultural milestones, worthy of
consideration in the high halls of society’s artistic achievements.</p>
<p>Are you this man?<br />
Do you have a girlfriend?<br />
Do you want her to appreciate video games the way you do?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to all of these questions, look no further: what
follows is a list of video games with which to introduce your girlfriend
to the fineness of the medium, at a comfortable pace which feels fun and
collaborative.</p>
<h3 id="baba-is-you">Baba Is You</h3>
<p>The problem is introducing her to video games gently (i.e., simple
controls, easy to understand, few assumptions of general gaming
knowledge) while providing a sufficiently engaging experience that she
is convinced of the worth of video games. The solution is <em>Baba Is
You</em>.</p>
<h3 id="minecraft">Minecraft</h3>
<p>As a 3D game, <em>Minecraft</em>’s controls are difficult. You may
consider playing with a gamepad rather than a mouse and keyboard. I’ve
found it can be slow to get acquainted with the mouse and keyboard as a
control scheme for 3D video games. However, <em>Minecraft</em> is wildly
appealing and fundamentally cooperative and creative. Turn on peaceful
mode or creative mode and build something together.</p>
<h3 id="fushimi-inari">Fushimi Inari</h3>
<p>A short pure walking game with 3D controls and a relaxed atmosphere,
<em>Fushimi Inari</em> is ideal for getting acquainted with 3D games in
an unstressful setting.</p>
<h3 id="terraria">Terraria</h3>
<p><em>Terraria</em> is more difficult than <em>Minecraft</em>—not in
terms of controls, but in gameplay challenges. Be patient and forgiving,
and don’t take it too seriously. Do not expect to finish it. Just build
a house.</p>
<h3 id="portal-2">Portal 2</h3>
<p>Cooperative puzzle game—suitable almost from the start, by design, if
using a gamepad.</p>
<h3 id="civilization-v">Civilization V</h3>
<p>Introduction to turn-based strategy and “map games”. Relaxed but
complex. Play against the computer, or perhaps each other, with a long
turn timer.</p>
<h3 id="hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</h3>
<p>A challenging platformer with appealing gameplay and visuals and an
expansive world. Install the multiplayer mod and play together on LAN.
<em>Take your time.</em></p>
<h3 id="skyrim">Skyrim</h3>
<p>Once she is comfortable enough with 3D games a bit of thrilling
action, show her <em>Skyrim</em> and explore a vast, immersive world.
Read all the books. Treat it like anthropology: with no instructions,
where does she go? How does she engage? A person’s first RPG experience
is something to cherish, as too often those of us familiar with the
genre carry certain expectations and play how we’ve learned to play,
having lost the sense of wonder and openness inherent to such games.
SkyUI is a must.</p>
<h3 id="red-dead-redemption-ii">Red Dead Redemption? II?</h3>
<p>I have not tried this, but I bet if she can handle Skyrim she can
handle RDR. Story-rich and similarly expansive and immersive, she might
enjoy one of the games lauded for masterful narrative and engaging
characters.</p>
<h3 id="disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</h3>

</p>
<p>She is a communist and she passes every real-life <span
style="color: lightskyblue"><strong>CONCEPTUALIZATION</strong></span>
check. This game has two buttons (left click and right click) and
instead of encounters involving real-time combat, they mostly feature
tactical conversation, like a Bene Gesserit. There has never been
anything more perfect for her.</p>
