<p>That’s a great place! However, New York is the center of the
universe.</p>
<h3 id="but-i-dont-like-new-york">But I don’t like New York!</h3>
<p>I’m sorry to hear that! I hope you have an enjoyable life somewhere
else. Nonetheless, New York is the center of the universe.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-aliens">What about aliens?</h3>
<p>I am willing to concede that somewhere out in the universe there may
be an alien civilization host to a city whose quality and importance
surpasses that of New York City. Lacking definitive evidence of their
existence, however, I maintain that New York is the center of the
universe.</p>
<h3 id="why-would-you-say-such-an-outrageous-thing">Why would you say
such an outrageous thing?</h3>
<p>Because New York, I believe, is the center of the universe.</p>

the universe.</p>
<h3 id="youre-wrong.">You’re wrong.</h3>
<p>That’s not a question. Still, this information comes to me from a
higher source. I cannot but conclude that New York is the center of the
universe.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Whenever anything important happens on Earth, there’s a good chance
it’s happening in New York.</p>
<p>Whenever anything important happens on Earth not in New York, New
York knows about it and New York is involved in it or about to be
involved in it.</p>
<p>Anyone who is anyone either lives in New York, has lived in New York,
or maintains important relationships with people who live in New
York.</p>
<p>New York launders human culture.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-a-good-thing">Is this a good thing?</h3>
<p>Almost certainly not.</p>
<h3 id="will-this-be-true-forever">Will this be true forever?</h3>
