<p>Here’s a tendency: poet hears notable things said in daily life.
Records them, writes them down. Later, throws them together, unedited,
calls it a poem. The fact that the quotes are taken out of context is
essential to the poem’s form.</p>
<p>I hate it! This trend of obfuscation, of decoherence. Poems are made
of references. To deny its provenance, to sever the link that leads from
reality to fiction is to cut away poetic essence.</p>
<p>It’s not that you need to know the process of a thing’s creation to
like it. I don’t need to know literally what each line of the poem
references. I don’t need a plaque explaining it. But hiding behind
decontextualized alluring lines? Poetic advantage is in getting straight
to the truth, with sleight of hand. Is it difficult? Yes, incredibly. To
make incoherence cohere is the responsibility of the writer, the editor,
the critic, even the journalist. It doesn’t have to sound like it makes
sense. But it has to make sense. It’s a very rare but notable case when
nonsense is accidentally great.</p>
<p>So why is it done? Why do poets cower behind decoherence? In the
tendency I described first (recording all, then slapping it down and
calling it poetry), self-justification goes like: there’s a hidden
oneness in all, a grand theme waiting to reveal itself the moment you
put all the recent notable moments in one place, find the places they
fit together. There is some truth to this; what we choose to record
often betrays some hidden emotional pattern, even if that pattern only
really exists post facto when looking at the raw material laid out. But
it’s very lazy. That’s bad because it’s <em>passive</em>. I don’t enjoy
looking at art replete with passivity.</p>
<p>Presuming the oneness in disparate things is so obvious. Actively
<em>seeking</em> the oneness is a different story. That’s the purview of
mathematics: taking two different things and prove they are really the
same—or at least neatly categorizing different things until they can all
fit into one nice hierarchy. Poetry, typically, is the opposite impulse:
the art of taking one thing and extracting many conflicting meanings
from it. Indeed, it is the subtle differences between things, the
boundaries separating one idea (or person) from another, that lend
individuality and cause friction and that friction is what reminds us
there is something really substantial there. A genuinely new idea can
only be seen in the places where it rubs roughly against that which
exists but does not easily make it cohere. You find the humanity in
another person where you bristle and frustrate each other, and only then
can you relate to each other as full people, rather than the uniform
universal presumptive perception. Every individual a different
species.</p>
<p>So passive poetry—journalistically recording and repeating what you
hear, assuming the unified theme will be revealed because all is one—and
following the trend of the times… these are ways to deny your
individuality. Which is another way of telling your reader you don’t
think of them as a real person.</p>
<p>The point: seek unity for all I care, but don’t assume it. Find it,
create it. Rote representation is not enough to reveal anything true or
interesting or new about the world and our lives in it. We killed
representative art in 1910. Now we must invent new patterns, and <em>be
active</em> in doing so.</p>
<p>Apologies; I tend to write out of frustration. My poems are all
philippics.</p>
