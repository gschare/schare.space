                <caption>The scenery was really giving Death Stranding. In fact it gave a lot of things; the rapid change in terrain as you hike high up into the peaks above the Lakes Basin felt like navigating different biomes in Minecraft. Starting with glacial lakes and lodgepole pines... keep going up and you find yourself among ferrous red sand on a crest overlooking the entire basin... continue further and you discover low scrubland reminiscent of much lower elevations... a dry mountainside evocative of the chaparral of home territory... then it's peak meadows full of flowers that smell strongly of maize, opposite a view of endless mountains fading into the horizon... the marshy Deer Lakes... rocky cliffs at the top of a trail composed of shattered stone... and finally scattered boulders and grasses as you see here, with the occasional patch of summer snow. The descent is an entirely different story - a much buggier one.</caption>

                    <caption>
                        There's a jazzy mural in the Lilypad and it reminds me
                        of the sort of painting my parents and grandparents have
                        in their house: musicians rendered cubistly, frenetic
                        atmosphere. Let the good times roll. You can make a
                        whole career off that sort of art; it's very
                        commercially viable, very pretty. And why not? I'm pretty sure
                        aesthetics are fascist&mdash;expecially when profound
                        confrontation of modernity is recast as nostalgic
                        kitsch&mdash;but wouldn't it be cool to live
                        in a Parisian fantasy? And the whole world is a
                        painting by Monet...
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Oh yes. That's been done. By Monet.

                        at night and I think of the scale of it, how many people
                        occupy those lighted rooms, this human-concrete machine,
                        how much ground I can cover in a day on the T, and I
                        feel in awe, and very lucky to be here.

                    Aside from forcing me to slow down and be deliberate when I

                    the pretension of "professional" DSLR or mirrorless cameras.

                    I'm using this fancy device to take pictures that are
                    intended to be nothing more than impressions of what I see
                    during the day, which I send to my friends. But it goes the
                    other way, too: this curious habit, negotiated by the camera
                    with all its fiddly settings and its "professional" affect,
                    is dignified beyond fleeting record and elevated to <em>craft</em>.
                    There's a ritual to it: take photos, get home, look through, and
                    <em>then</em> send them off.
