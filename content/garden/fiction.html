<p>Why are we surprised that <em>Nosferatu</em> is funny?</p>
<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is funny. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> is funny.
<em>Don Quixote</em> is well-known to be funny. And more from the
Western canon: Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>, Borges’s
<em>Ficciones</em> (title tells you everything), Shakespeare’s plays,
Plato’s <em>Symposium</em>. These are, to varying degrees, all satire,
all lampooning the society in which they were written! Keep searching;
you’ll only find more to support my observation.</p>
<p>Rana asks: how come, in our education on classical literature, we
seem to only read satire like Cervantes and Austen?</p>
<p><em>There is nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>All great literature is satire. Irony is a prerequisite. Nothing
important can be said without a current of humor. Telling a story is,
inherently, satire of life! <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"

<p>Every writer knows, deep down, that to sit down and write is,
necessarily, to adopt an ironic disposition—to make fun at the expense
of something else. (You can, of course, set out to tell a joke and then
tell a bad joke.)</p>
<p>But do not mistake irony for disgust.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Don Quixote</em> could only have been written by someone who
really loved chivalric romances, really wanted his life to resemble them
more closely, and understood just what it would cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Elif Batuman, <em>The Possessed</em></p>

<p>It is weird to compose fiction. The moment you acknowledge that what
you are doing is fiction, you have admitted to telling a lie. The gap
between reality and the story hangs over the work as a wellspring of
irony and humor. The artfulness of storytelling lies in the interplay
between that awareness and the suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>If we admit that to tell a story is to weave a lie, where does that
leave the audience, apparently gullible fools eating up this nonsense?
In fact they are in on it. Part of fiction’s inherent humor is the basic
dramatic irony that the audience knows it is a lie!</p>
<div class="fancyquote">
<blockquote>
<p>[When I write,] I am describing certain aspects of pyschological
reality in the novelist’s way, which is by inventing elaborately
circumstantial lies.</p>
<p>In reading a novel, any novel, we have to know perfectly well that
the whole thing is nonsense, and then, while reading, believe every word
of it.</p>
<p>[…] All fiction is metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Ursula K. Le Guin, Author’s Note to <em>The Left Hand of
Darkness</em> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"

</div>
<p>We know when we are being lied to. We choose to believe it, because
we can learn just as much from well-constructed lies as we might from
well-constructed truths.</p>
<p>Everyone involved in this delusion knows exactly what is going on.
Watch blooper reels from film and television; when actors break, in the
most serious scenes, the veil is pierced, they burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing Lee Maracle: I learned storytelling from my grandfather.
I was a child, and I told him a lie. He said, “That’s a good story. Tell
it again, differently.”</p>
<p>Thus fiction emerges from collaborative lying.</p>

<p>Apollo, the god of light, of reason, of proportion, harmony,
number—Apollo blinds those who press too close in worship. Don’t look
straight at the sun. Go into a dark bar for a bit and have a beer with
Dionysios, every now and then.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>I might as well disclaim that my
criterion that a story be “humorous” or “ironic” or “satirical” must not
be taken so strictly that we count as fiction only those stories which
get generically categorized under “Comedy.” Putting aside the fact that
this genre is a relatively recent invention, let me just observe that my
idea of humor includes such a simple thing as portraying characters who,
when placed in an unbelievably melodramatic scenario, react with a
reasonable degree of realism. It also includes the opposite: unexpected
reactions to mundane scenarios. Each implicitly satirizes real life.
Finally, even the most serious drama toes the line of absurdity; the
film ends and the curtain closes, and I grin, because of how
embarrassing it is to find I have been, once again, willingly
deceived!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
