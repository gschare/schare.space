<h3 id="marxism">Marxism</h3>
<p>Marxist concept of history is a huge part of how I understand the
world—or at least one of the lenses I reach for when looking at a
phenomenon from various angles.</p>
<p>The major sources here are Karl Marx, some writers from the Third
International (Lenin and Luxemburg, mainly), and the critical theorists
of the Frankfurt School: Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and, my
favorite, Max Horkheimer. If I had to recommend just one short piece: <a
href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/horkheimer/1931/Little-man.pdf">The
Little Man and the Philosophy of Freedom</a> by Horkheimer.</p>
<p>I learned most of what I know about Marxism from <a
href="https://platypus1917.org/">the Platypus Affiliated Society</a>, by
participating in their year-long Primary Marxist Reading Group in the
2020-21 session. I was lucky enough to be taught by Erin Hagood.</p>
<h3 id="computer-science">Computer science</h3>
<p>The technical jargon of computer science turns out to be very handy
in expediently articulating complex concepts to those with the right
shared context. I’ll give you an example of what I mean. While I was
visiting MIT to decide if I wanted to do my PhD studies there, Adam
Chlipala asked me, “what state transition are you hoping to achieve by
executing the PhD function?” Granted, this example can be expressed
pretty well in normal-people-language, but that’s why it is good for
illustration here: the non-computer scientists reading this may be able
to infer what he was asking, which was simply, “what are you hoping to
achieve by doing a PhD?” or more specifically, “how do you expect to be
different at the end of your PhD compared to now, and why is doing a PhD
the best way to accomplish this change?”</p>
<p>I tend to draw my metaphors from basic data structures and
algorithms, and from the field of programming languages and compilers. I
also take some from pure mathematics.</p>
<p>My favorite is <strong>hill climbing</strong>. Coming from
mathematical optimization, hill climbing studies the problem of finding
an appropriate path to the highest point on a curved surface which may
contain hills and valleys. There is one globally highest point, but if
you only look greedily for ascending slopes, you may reach a lower
<em>local maximum</em>. In the metaphor, this local maximum feels like
the best you can hope for, because all other immediate paths seem to
point downwards to lower levels of [happiness, wealth, comfort].
Metaphorically speaking, most complex problems we face in real life are
not convex (there is not one obvious path to the best solution).
Reaching the global maximum requires taking some risks and even
accepting a temporarily worse situation before it gets better. One
common example: therapy for mental health.</p>
<p>I have the kindling of an argument for why this pidgin can be so
effective. Computer science is rich in techniques for talking about
abstract things: defining them, comparing them, transforming them.
Programmers tend to keep a question in the back of their minds at all
times: “how can I make this more general?” Some people argue computer
science is the study of abstraction. Others argue it is the study of
complexity (and how to manage it effectively). So the century of work
that has gone into developing the vocabulary, logics, and systems used
by computer science for managing complexity can be pretty well applied
to everyday scenarios that touch on this universal concept of
complexity. Sometimes I think if you strip away the engineering aspects
of computer science, what remains looks pretty much like applied
philosophy.</p>
<p>Also, computer science, like any field, creates jargon like this in
order to enable people to recognize common patterns so they can reuse
old solutions to solved problems. There can be a “when all you have is a
hammer, everything looks like a nail” effect here, but when done well it
is a great thing to be able to look at an obstacle and immediately
reframe it in your mind into something you already know how to deal
with. Indeed, in math and computer science, this technique has a formal
term: reduction. Computer science theory (specifically complexity theory
and computability theory) are more or less about learning one or two
known solutions and then a whole host of techniques for reshaping new
problems into a form that is compatible with those known solutions.
Likewise, parsimony is highly valued in programming languages; the fewer
basic abstractions you need and the more you can express one idea in
terms of another, the more efficient your algorithm can be. That
training, I think, generalizes to some extent so that the mind of a
computer scientist is uniquely adept at memorizing general, abstract
patterns and recalling them when equivalent configurations arise in the
wild.</p>
<h3 id="tools-for-conviviality-by-ivan-illich"><em>Tools for
Conviviality</em> by Ivan Illich</h3>
<p>The (extremely brief) pitch of this book is: in order to achieve true
progress and positive social outcomes from advances in technology, tools
typically reserved to experts must become accessible to
non-professionals. Examples include literacy, basic medical knowledge,
and, for those computer scientists who read this book today, the art of
programming.</p>
<h3 id="queer-theory">Queer theory</h3>
<p>I.e., queerness as a critical term in the philosophy of power. See:
Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, <a
href="https://platypus1917.org/wp-content/uploads/demiliojohn_capitalismgayidentity.pdf">John
D’Emilio</a>, and Adrienne Rich.</p>
<p>For the basics you can see the “breadtube” YouTube channels
<em>Contrapoints</em> and <em>Philosophy Tube</em>. I also like
<em>Shonalika</em>.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent reasons I reference queer studies is to make
the point that identity is not inherently revolutionary. Capitalism has
a tendency to integrate all critique of itself within itself; “rainbow
capitalism,” where LGBT identity is accepted into the mainstream and
commodified, is the latest instance of this.</p>
<h3 id="scientific-empiricism">Scientific empiricism</h3>
<p>Oh man, I feel almost unqualified to write this here because I have
not deeply studied Hume and Quine. Yes, I studied science in high school
like everyone else, and yes, I considered myself an atheist or agnostic
for a long time, and yes, I felt a kinship with those liberal democrat
lawn signs that say “SCIENCE IS REAL!” But since learning some
introductory philosophy of science, reading <em>Tools for
Conviviality</em>, and getting exposed to other epistemological systems,
I am a bit less obsessed with this. Still, a confidence in the practical
predictive power of scientific empricism is central to my personal
epistemology. I do not go around under the assumption that a demon from
a thought experiment is deluding my senses, confirming my inductive
hypotheses, or moving high-energy particles to low-energy areas and not
the other way around. I tend, rather, to operate on the assumption that
science is a pretty good approximation of what we might colloquially
call “objective base reality.” Whether or not there actually exists an
objective base reality is, unfortunately, a subject for a different area
of philosophy.</p>
<p>For a related example, I did some work during undergrad for a lab
called the Making and Knowing Project, which studies a very fascinating
period of history in which European artisans began to do their work in
ways that look like the beginnings of the scientific method. They were
doing alchemy, essentially, but they were experimenting and writing down
results and sharing knowledge amongst themselves. Not much later, Isaac
Newton was forming mathematical theories of optics and gravity in the
academy. The interplay of aristocratic and bourgeois proto-science shows
us that the history of ideas has a lot to tell us about how we currently
think about the world and the process by which we collectively develop a
better understanding of it.</p>
<h3 id="abrahamic-religion">Abrahamic religion</h3>
<p>I mean, it’s sort of hard to avoid this in the Global North. Most of
us grew up either practicing one of Islam, Christianity, or Judaism, or
we grew up in a society hegemonically organized around these religions.
As a result I cannot help but have them readily available as references
and influences.</p>
<h3 id="the-bhagavad-gita">The Bhagavad Gita</h3>
<p>I recently read the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> and I found it compelling.
Now it sits in an esteemed place in my intellectual vocabulary.</p>
<h3 id="psychoanalysis-related-periphery-of-woo">Psychoanalysis, related
periphery of “woo”</h3>
<p>For the former, my references are mainly Wilhelm Reich, Slavoj Zizek,
Alenka Zupancic, Camille Paglia, and my old psychoanalyst. For the
latter, unfortunately, it’s so far just Twitter and talking to people
with worldviews that differ from mine in dramatic ways… and
reinterpreting everything I’ve read in the past with a broader
epistemology and more openness to spirituality.</p>
<p>While psychoanalysis and pseudoscience do not hold up to a rigorous
empirical standard, they can still be extremely useful vocabularies for
talking about things which defy description and which often lack
scientific consensus.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, early European science began with alchemy. I
have hope that a similar pattern will unfold as we develop a science of
mysticism.</p>
<h3 id="some-key-undergraduate-classes">Some key undergraduate

<p>Notice the absence of elective literature and philosophy classes. Oh
how I wish I took more classes in those areas! Instead I guess I’m
really good at functional programming, or something.</p>

<h2 id="narrative-fiction">Narrative Fiction</h2>
<h3 id="game-of-thrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em></h3>
<p>Though I remember the summer of 2023 as a time of joyful friendship,
I spent a good deal of time alone with <em>Game of Thrones</em> and it
is through this work that I came to appreciate the notion of an “open
story”—that is, a story set in a fictional world which feels expansive
because the creator put immense effort into the details that convey
verisimilitude. When done well, the result is a work that takes on a
life of its own, permitting endless speculation and fanfiction. <em>Game
of Thrones</em> is a work that achieves this. Every political maneuver
is entirely consistent with the rest of the events occurring in the vast
story, and consistent with the psychology of each character. It is
mystifying how GRRM achieved this, and D&amp;D are worthy of further
praise for faithfully adapting it to the screen… aside from the
well-known grave error towards the end. I recall one afternoon I walked
around running errands while staying on the phone with Rana the entire
time, the two of us verbally creating an outline of how we would rewrite
Season 8 to better conclude the story. In a sense, the total flop of the
final season makes it all the more tantalizing to consider how it could
have ended. Imperfection begets engagement, because we strive for
perfection. Perhaps it was intentional.</p>
<h3 id="dune-by-frank-herbert"><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert</h3>
<p>A veritable classic that endures due to its sophisticated story
weaving together ecology, religion, politics, psychedelics, and what I
consider to be a textual trans allegory. Like <em>Game of Thrones</em>,
it has excellent worldbuilding, making it a great subject for <a
href="/garden/books/dune.html">StackOverflow nerdsniping sessions</a>. I
find myself frequently referencing it for its memorable quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Fear is the mind-killer.”</li>
<li>“The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to
experience.”</li>
</ul>
<p>and I adopt as metaphors/allusions the character of Muad’dib, the
Fremen terraforming dream, and the false prophet narrative configuration
in everyday conversation.</p>
<h3 id="neon-genesis-evangelion"><em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em></h3>
<p>The third in this sequence of great sci-fi and fantasy epics with
rich worlds, I loved <em>Evangelion</em> on my first watch for its
artistic portrayal of the pain of loneliness, and on my second watch I
learned to appreciate the depth of its lore. It is incredibly fun to
speculate about the sci-fi concepts in <em>Evangelion</em>, which appear
at first glance to be mostly sci-fi mumbo-jumbo for flavor, but in fact
turn out to have a sort of biblical omnisignificance apt for the subject
matter.</p>
<h3 id="video-games">Video games</h3>
<p>I’ve played a lot of video games and many of them were rich,
evocative experiences that echo in my memory ever since. Here are some
key ones that I think of often:</p>
<ul>
<li>NaissanceE</li>
<li>Disco Elysium</li>
<li>Rodina</li>
<li>Hollow Knight</li>
<li>Dishonored</li>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Skyrim</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more">More…</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>The Magicians</em> (both the book and the TV series)
<ul>
<li>“just a little minor mending…”</li>
<li>“Repair of small objects.”<br />
“How does it feel?”<br />
“Like I helped it wake up and remember what it was before.”</li>
<li>the whole “magic comes from unhappiness” shtick</li>
<li>“isn’t the <em>idea</em> of Fillory enough?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> (animated TV series)</li>
<li><em>Adventure Time</em></li>
</ul>
