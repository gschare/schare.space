Perhaps you’ve noticed that a lot of social interaction has moved
online, which means the technology that facilitates and governs social
relation is the application layer of the internet. This technology is
constantly evolving. To grip it in our hands, to mold it like clay with
the intentional hands of a maker, is to architect social interaction and
the dynamics of community. The status quo—the algorithmic feed as the
dominant mode of engagement—delegates this task to the gods of linear
algebra. Do not be confused by the common wisdom that people are
irrational and computers cold and calculating; the models’ dataset
consists of the daily activity of hundreds of millions of irrational
humans. What would it look like for a rational agent to carefully design
the substrate on which all online interactions occur? What would such a
rational agent even be?</p>
<p>“Anthropologists hitherto have sought to understand societies. The
point is to change them.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the embarrassment of the field of anthropology is that its
adherents never learned JavaScript.</p>

I wish I could explore the latent space of algorithmic feeds. That I
could pretend to be someone else for a day. Modulo privacy, I wish I
could temporarily take on the algorithm my friends have, and experience
the digital world through their eyes for a day. Or if I’m curious about
something, to skip the arduous process of articulating my interest
through search and engagement with that thing, and just go right to the
area. There is so much good that can be done with algorithmic feeds, and
we’re not doing any of it.</p>

I find it moderately hilarious that we commonly copy-paste passages from
Wikipedia, but because hypertext is not ubiquitous, it ends up looking
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harris attended Vanier College in Montreal in 1981–82,[29] and then
attended Howard University, a historically black university in
Washington, D.C.[30][31] She graduated in 1986 with a degree in
political science and economics.[32] Harris then attended the University
of California, Hastings College of the Law,[33] where she served as
president of its chapter of the Black Law Students Association.[34] She
graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1989.[35]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s are gone but those unadorned references
remain. When hyperlinks are attached to phrases rather than explicit
superscripted footnote references, the effect is less obvious. Here, the
absence of the link is made frustratedly ironic by the lingering
footnote number—a number separated from its context, useless. An
imperfect perfect copy: all of the syntax and none of the richer
semantics. An apt metaphor for the uncautious user who may hastily
copy-paste a passage to defend a point, thinking this plaintext will
corroborate, but the method of citation betrays this unscrupulous act.
In a passage copied with the intention of using it to prove a claim, an
unlinked footnote emphasizes the absence of evidence. Even more
tantalizing, consider if it was a screenshot. The links remain blue, but
inaccessible.</p>
<p>Or they were careful to verify their point, and there is no other way
to responsibly quote the article, because removing the footnotes would
be busiwork that detracts from the strength of the evidence, because the
syntax of copy-pasted Wikipedia passages are so familiar in online
spaces like Twitter that they function satisfactorily as evidence in a
web-browser enabled environment where readers can just, once again, copy
the quoted passage and search it to retrieve the article. You can even
do it from a screenshot with modern OCR capabilities.</p>
<p>Either way, there is so much more that can be done with
copy-paste.</p>

What would it look like to design an operating system around deep
linking, where every object was persistent and could be referenced
(e.g. by a hash)?</p>
<p>How far can hypermedia go?</p>
<p>Can I link to any character in a document, anywhere on my computer?
Can I link to the result of a completed shell command from 2 days ago?
Can I link to a subset of user configurations (wouldn’t that help with
troubleshooting!)?</p>
<p>Can I link to an arbitrary set of pixels in a specific layer of a
Photoshop file, as if using the lasso tool?</p>
<p>Consider the implications of that last question: a proprietary
format, a low-level object of reference, and a domain-specific selection
query.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting than the implementation question, though, is
the impact: what would it mean for the way we use computers if
practically everything we can conceptualize digitally is able to
referenced?</p>

I often hear this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I like [math | computer science | science | engineering] because
there’s a Right Answer.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication is there is no right answer in humanities. I can’t
say much about humanities, but I believe this “Right” in STEM is less
about the experience of arriving at the one correct answer, and more
about the feeling of reaching a solution that <em>feels</em> right,
according to a vague but useful intuition. In this way, the Right in a
mathematics problem set or program implementation is not dissimilar to
the creative sense of a writer or artist or designer. When writing a
story or poem and I come upon a way of expressing myself that feels
Right, I recognize the feeling from arriving at a satisfying way to
prove a mathematical theorem or an elegant piece of code that solves my
problem. Knowing you are Right in these cases is more a matter of taste
and experience than it is about logically knowing you cannot be
wrong.</p>
