What would it look like to design an operating system around deep
linking, where every object was persistent and could be referenced
(e.g. by a hash)?</p>
<p>How far can hypermedia go?</p>
<p>Can I link to any character in a document, anywhere on my computer?
Can I link to the result of a completed shell command from 2 days ago?
Can I link to a subset of user configurations (wouldn’t that help with
troubleshooting!)?</p>
<p>Can I link to an arbitrary set of pixels in a specific layer of a
Photoshop file, as if using the lasso tool?</p>
<p>Consider the implications of that last question: a proprietary
format, a low-level object of reference, and a domain-specific selection
query.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting than the implementation question, though, is
the impact: what would it mean for the way we use computers if
practically everything we can conceptualize digitally is able to
referenced?</p>

I often hear this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I like [math | computer science | science | engineering] because
there’s a Right Answer.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The implication is there is no right answer in humanities. I can’t
say much about humanities, but I believe this “Right” in STEM is less
about the experience of arriving at the one correct answer, and more
about the feeling of reaching a solution that <em>feels</em> right,
according to a vague but useful intuition. In this way, the Right in a
mathematics problem set or program implementation is not dissimilar to
the creative sense of a writer or artist or designer. When writing a
story or poem and I come upon a way of expressing myself that feels
Right, I recognize the feeling from arriving at a satisfying way to
prove a mathematical theorem or an elegant piece of code that solves my
problem. Knowing you are Right in these cases is more a matter of taste
and experience than it is about logically knowing you cannot be
wrong.</p>
