  <summary>[The Synthesis of Algorithmic Systems ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1283920.1283921) by Alan J. Perlis</summary>

  Historical curiosity from the era where software was just beginning to
  emerge as a serious object of study, in which Perlis outlines a vague vision
  of future programming UX that is more flexible, interactive, general, and
  high-level. Shortly after this lecture, some of these ideas---portability,
  metaprogramming, interpretation, first-class functions, syntax for parallel
  and distributed control flow, facilities for implementing new data
  structures, and formal semantics of PL---were formalized and accomplished and
  now form the basis of the field of programming languages (think Java, C++
  templating, ML, CSP and its successors, and ISWIM); while those that weren't
  formalized---liveness, interactivity, syntax variation---were essentially
  forgotten, at least in the mainstream. Racket, Clojure, and Smalltalk carry
  on some of his vision; experimental research projects carry on others. Funny
  how we can never tell what will be solved in a handful of years and what will
  elude us for over half a century. Reading old lectures where the formalisms
  are still in flux has the wonderful effect of unmooring the imagination,
  inviting one to dream differently and question foundational assumptions. I
  highly recommend it.
