<p>Paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she
stumbled into him.</p>
<p>He was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they
stood atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean
some two hundred meters below.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“Open desert,” she said.</p>
<p>“A wide place to cross,” Paul said.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“There’s a way to get safely across that open sand,” Paul said. “The
Fremen do it. […] If we crossed there making only <em>natural</em>
sounds, the kind that don’t attract the worms. . . .”</p>
<p>“It’d have to be sounds without rhythm,” Jessica said.</p>
