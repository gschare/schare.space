<p>Orla O’Donovan, quoting Erich Fromm in her critique of <em>Tools for
Conviviality</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, argues that the value of Illich’s
ideas “lies in the fact that they have a liberating effect on the mind
by showing entirely new possibilities” for leftist political strategy in
the postsocialist condition in which we find ourselves today, where the
Left suffers from (quoting O’Donovan now) not just a “crisis in
confidence” but “the absence of a broad vision.” His radical, often
implacable questioning forces the reader to re-examine the thoughtless
“anti” and “equal access” that characterize the dying Left’s custodial
opposition to neoliberal movements. Reading Illich’s theory we hope to
be free from this prison of “sterile, preconceived notions” of justice
so that we may once again gain ground on social progress without
capitulation to, for example, hegemonic debates over access to
anti-convivial healthcare. In short: his ideas allow us to critique the
system over the policy, even as the Left is relegated, in its exile, to
the arena of local politics.</p>
<p>But I am suspicious of this attitude. On the one hand, reading Illich
for his way of thinking and not for the things he thought allows us to
elevate his critique beyond his own biases. O’Donovan demonstrates this
when she criticizes Illich’s antiquated sexism—both in his personal
comportment and in his writing—but then relates his theory to the
politics of gender in reproductive technology. Perhaps the ideas are
greater than the man. On the other hand, ignoring the content of his
book we are left with little to say and less to do. O’Donovan helpfully
points out that Illich’s project “raises difficult questions.”</p>
<p>I believe <em>Tools for Conviviality</em> has more to offer. Beyond
his basic orientation that aligns with the sociological study of
technology, and his rhetoric of ruthless critique, there are, at the
heart of this book, normative claims. Illich puts forth a very specific
vision for a convivial society, rooted in specific criteria that
identify convivial relations and their opposites. It is my belief that
these ideas have value not just for leftist politics and theoreticians,
but for designers, researchers, and engineers developing social tools,
as I cannot comprehend a Left that does not take itself seriously enough
to mobilize in the offices and laboratories where the tools are created
that embed anti-convivial ideology into the technological world. And it
is my intention to study these arguments in conflict with the evolution
of technology and capitalism since 1971, and, if possible, use Illich as
a springboard and carve out a system of ideas that effectively captures
the vision, ethics, requirements, spiritual necessity, and political
strategy of humane technology, from highways and cars to restaurants and
bars to websites and paperwork to drugs and houses to workplaces and
schools.</p>
<p>To this end I present a brief summary of Illich’s main points below,
along with arguments that I find suitable for deployment as a liberating
force in activism, via quotation with occasional commentary. I hope this
book of quotes may present the liberating opportunities treasured by
Fromm and O’Donovan while authentically preserving Illich’s
vision—whether or not we agree with it.</p>

I often hear complaints about "consumerism" but never do I hear talk of an
alternative. Until reading Illich.

<!-- Illich's words on deprofessionalization have a strange resonance in this
time when the rallying cry of artificial intelligence is, in some corrupted
form, deprofessionalization. AI, it is claimed, will deliver to the masses the
tools of the professionals so that the professionals cannot hold a monopoly on
them. -->
