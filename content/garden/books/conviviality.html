<p>Orla O’Donovan, quoting Erich Fromm in her critique of <em>Tools for
Conviviality</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, argues that the value of Illich’s
ideas “lies in the fact that they have a liberating effect on the mind
by showing entirely new possibilities” for leftist political stragegy in
the postsocialist condition in which we find ourselves today, where the
Left suffers from not just a “crisis in confidence” but “the absence of
a broad vision.” His radical, often implacable questioning forces the
reader to re-examine the thoughtless “anti” and “equal access” that
characterize the dying Left’s custodial opposition to neoliberal
movements. The hope is reading Illich’s theory will free us from this
prison of “sterile, preconceived notions” of justice so that we may once
again gain ground on social progress without capitulation to, for
example, hegemonic debates over access to anti-convivial healthcare. In
short: his ideas allow us to critique the system over the policy, even
as the Left is relegated, in its exile, to the arena of local
politics.</p>
<p>I am not convinced this is the sole value of <em>Tools for
Conviviality</em>. O’Donovan more or less admits that she disregards the
bulk of Illich’s normative claims, and only finds value in the style of
his rhetoric and his no-holds-barred approach to make a ruthless
critique of everything existing—no matter the content of that critique.
In fact, Illich puts forth a very specific vision for a convivial
society, rooted in specific criteria that identify convivial relations
and their opposites. It is my belief that these ideas have value not
just for leftist politics, but for designers, researchers, and engineers
developing social tools, as I cannot comprehend a Left that does not
take itself seriously enough to mobilize in the offices and laboratories
where the tools are created that embed anti-convivial ideology into the
technological world. And it is my intention to study these arguments in
conflict with the evolution of technology and capitalism since 1971,
and, if possible, use Illich as a springboard and carve out a system of
ideas that effectively captures the vision, ethics, requirements,
spiritual necessity, and political strategy of humane technology, from
highways and cars to restaurants and bars to websites and paperwork to
drugs and houses to workplaces and schools.</p>
<p>To this end I present a brief summary of Illich’s main points below,
along with arguments that I find suitable for deployment as a liberating
force in activism, via quotation with occasional commentary. I hope this
book of quotes may present the liberating opportunities treasured by
Fromm and O’Donovan while authentically preserving Illich’s
vision—whether or not we agree with it.</p>
