<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>To walk in the park on Saturday or Sunday in spring or summer when
everyone—families barbecuing, athletes exercising, ambling cartpushers,
picnicking romantics—are out there too.</li>
<li>To cook with music on and someone to talk to while you stir
fry.</li>
<li>To spend a morning together, then return and rest, then change
outfits and go out again for evening plans.</li>
<li>To exit a building and find sunshine after class.</li>
<li>Banter. Riffs and bits. Callbacks.</li>
<li>To surrender to severe weather.</li>
<li>To finally get out of the house at noon, and find the day sunny and
warm.</li>
<li>To commute home at night later than you’d like but you can play your
favorite music as loud as you’d like in your ears.</li>
<li>To attend a party where you know almost everyone.</li>
<li>To host an event for your friends—to put your heart and reputation
on the line in the pursuit of community and have it succeed through the
power of sheer love.</li>
<li>Having bathed yourself, to slip into bed with clean sheets.</li>
</ol>
