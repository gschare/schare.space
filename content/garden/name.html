<p>Gregory -&gt; Carmel</p>
<h2 id="short-version">Short Version</h2>
<p>I’m going by Carmel in non-legal settings. That means I’m Carmel in
social and professional life, MIT’s HR system, and my online presence,
but not on my driver’s license, passport, or taxes.</p>
<p>I won’t be offended if you still call me Gregory (that is also my
name) but I prefer Carmel.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="wait-i-dont-get-it.-what-do-i-call-you">Wait, I don’t get it.
What do I call you?</h3>
<p>You can call me whatever you’re used to calling me, and you can
additionally call me Carmel. I have a preference for the latter in the
same way I have a preference for “Gregory” over “Greg.”</p>
<p>My full name is Carmel Schare or Gregory Schare.</p>
<p>I also accept Gigi, though things may start to get confusing with
that many names so if you want to use that, maybe refrain from using it
outside of casual social settings.</p>
<h3 id="why-carmel">Why Carmel?</h3>
<p>Carmel has been one of my given names my entire life, since my bris.
I like how it sounds and I like its associations as explained to me by
my parents.</p>
<h3 id="what-prompted-the-change">What prompted the change?</h3>
<p>I feel a deeper connection with the name Carmel.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-political">Is this political?</h3>
<p>No. (I’ve been experimenting with the name change for several years,
long before 2023. In general, I do not identify with Zionism.)</p>
<h3 id="are-you-transgender">Are you transgender?</h3>
<p>I don’t know. Are you?</p>
<h3 id="you-cant-do-that.">You can’t do that.</h3>
<p>That’s not a question. Also, yes I can.</p>
