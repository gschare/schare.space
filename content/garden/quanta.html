On energetic quanta and frustration
</title>
<p>A recurrent theme in <em>Tools for Conviviality</em> <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> is
the old ways of life becoming inadmissible in the modern industrial
state. If Marx and Engels noted this phenomenon, unique to industrial
capitalism, in 1848—“all that is solid melts into air”—then Illich
explains its dynamics.</p>
<p>In the final piece of his analysis of how tools can upset the balance
of life, he presents the concept of “frustration,” the most subtle
scenario in which tools can be anti-convivial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a form of malfunction in which growth does not yet tend
toward the destruction of life, yet renders a tool antagonistic to its
specific aims. Tools, in other words, have an optimal, a tolerable, and
a negative range. Tolerable overefficiency also disturbs a balance, but
a balance of a subtler and more subjective kind than those discussed
before. The balance here threatened is that between personal cost and
return. It can be expressed more generally as the perception of the
balance between means and ends. When ends become subservient to the
tools chosen for their sake, the user first feels frustration and
finally either abstains from their use or goes mad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This disruption in the balance of means and ends is a familiar yet
vague point. Illich merely presents this as the thematic consequence of
the specific phenomenon which he describes below.</p>
<section id="contradictory-motion" class="level2">
<h2>Contradictory motion</h2>
<p>He picks the example of the efficiency of transportation. When
transportational tools become overefficient—which happens not much
beyond the speed of an ordinary bicycle—we net diminishing returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our present tools are engineered to deliver professional energies.
Such energies come in quanta. Less than a quantum cannot be delivered.
Less than four years of schooling is worse than none. It only defines
the former pupil as a dropout. This is equally true in medicine,
transportation, and housing, as in agriculture and in the administration
of justice. Mechanical transportation is worthwhile only at certain
speeds. . . . The planting of new grains is productive only if the
acreage and capital of the farmer are beyond a certain size. . . .</p>
<p>In a society where speedy transportation is taken for granted . . .
activities related to the use of speedy vehicles by many people in a
society occupy an increasing percentage of the time budget of most
members of that society, as the speed of the vehicles increases beyond a
certain point. Beyond this point the competition of transportation
activities with stationary activities becomes fierce, especially
competition for the allocation of limited real estate and available
energy. This competition seems to grow exponentially with the rise of
speed. The time reserved for commuting displaces both work and leisure
time. Hence, the speedier vehicles are, the more it becomes important to
keep them filled at all times. If they are individual capsules, they
tend to become disproportionately costly and scarce. If they are public
vehicles, they tend to be large, and run at infrequent intervals or
along only a few routes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently encountered these consequences in my daily life. I live in
Cambridge, MA, which is a relatively dense urban area where all space is
given up to buildings and roads shared by cars, pedestrians, and
cyclists. There is no spare real estate, there are no country paths or
open fields (perhaps to my chagrin). Because of its density and
walkability, is a very livable city, and I find myself wishing I owned a
car in only two scenarios. One is when I want to travel outside the
city, for example to go skiing. The other, and the subject of
<em>my</em> frustration, is when I want to move furniture.</p>
<p>On Facebook Marketplace I found a beautiful, stately desk, listed for
free, in Somerville, the neighboring town. It would be probably no more
than a 30 or 40 minute walk, all the time on reasonably well-maintained
sidewalks and completely safe places. But I cannot carry a desk in my
hands; it is too heavy and too big. I might be able to wheel it on a
handtruck or a small wagon, but it would be difficult. I would struggle
almost constantly as I navigate damaged concrete, tight paths too narrow
even to walk abreast another person, and, at this time of year, huge
piles of snow, slush, and ice obstructing nearly every curb ramp. This
reality makes moving things in Cambridge on foot difficult for the same
reason that handicapped persons who use wheelchairs to get around will
certainly suffer from the state of Cambridge’s sidewalks. But
conviviality, as a lens of analysis, informs us that these realities are
a result of tractable phenomena related to the industrial conception of
public roads—that our tools are socially determined, and thus subject to
reimagining.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Me when Camberville has convivial
sidewalks and I can wheel furniture in my wagon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Those sidewalks are small and poorly maintained because there is not
sufficient economic reason to maintain them. Cars demand more attention
and more resources in order to break even on their overefficiency. Were
we to make the sidewalks bigger, maintain them better, we would have to
allocate precious resources—space, money—away from the cars which depend
on them more desperately. A bigger sidewalk, or traffic lights more
generous in time to pedestrians, and then cars are slower, their drivers
more anxious, and their realized efficiency may dip below the minimal
necessary quanta to justify their use. We may, futilely, attempt to
rectify the situation in the arena of local politics, but there as
everywhere else, tools will remain subservient to the calculated logic
of industrial energies, and humans will remain subservient to those
tools.</p>
<p>My argument here is not that my dream of moving a desk on a wagon is
<em>impossible</em>, but that the entire arrangement of our built
environment is inherently antagonistic to endeavors like this—endeavors
which I would argue are extremely common and reasonable. As Illich is
quick to tell us, people used to travel everywhere on foot, by wagon,
or, when the load or distance really demanded it, by small, tough
motortrucks. This changed only in the last century. He cites by example
the infrastructural developments in Mexico under President Càrdenas in
the 1930s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In exchange for an occasional ride on an upholstered seat in an
air-conditioned bus, the common man has lost much of the mobility the
old system gave him, without gaining any new freedom. Research done in
two typical large states of Mexico—one dominated by deserts, the other
by mountains and lush growth–confirms this conclusion. Less than one
percent of the population in either state traveled a distance of over
fifteen miles in any one hour during 1970. More appropriate pushcarts
and bicycles, both motorized when needed, would have presented a
technologically much more efficient solution for 99 percent of the
population than the vaunted highway development. Such pushcarts could
have been built and maintained by people trained on the job, and
operated on roadbeds built to Inca standards, yet covered to diminish
drag.</p>

<section id="radical-monopoly" class="level2">
<h2>Radical Monopoly</h2>
<p>So in Mexico, so in the rest of the world, eventually all fell into
line under the tyranny of cars, and forced into a certain lifestyle
depend on them. The dominance of speedy transportation is an instance of
what Illich calls “radical monopoly.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By “radical monopoly” I mean the dominance of one type of product
rather than the dominance of one brand. I speak about radical monopoly
when one industrial production process exercises an exclusive control
over the satisfaction of a pressing need, and excludes nonindustrial
activities from competition. . . .</p>
<p>Cars can thus monopolize traffic. They can shape a city into their
image—practically ruling out locomotion on foot or by bicycle in Los
Angeles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lens of analysis is one of Illich’s most portable contributions
to the field of sociology, to the study of social tools. Instances can
be found everywhere, and the framework is useful even if you disagree
with his overall thesis.</p>
<p>(Another example, close to my heart, is that of software. The tools
involved in the creation of modern software are so complex and inhuman
that they can only be used by professionals. So the need for small
pieces of software is satisfied only—and insufficiently—by large
corporations making software in a one-size-fits-all manner.)</p>
<p>The key point of radical monopoly is not what it provides, but what
is excludes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Radical monopoly imposes compulsory consumption and thereby restricts
personal autonomy. It constitutes a special kind of social control
because it is enforced by means of the imposed consumption of a standard
product that only large institutions can provide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our case, the wagon is the personal tool being obstructed by
industrial means. The obstruction is literal in this case—the narrow
sidewalks. There is also a legal obstruction; were I to take my wagon on
the road I might be cited by a police officer, because it is illegal to
use public space in that way. Most interestingly, there is a moral
obstruction. In that same scenario of bringing my wagon to the road, I
am likely to attract the violent ire of a motorist far before being
caught by a police officer. Under radical monopoly we all become
militant enforcers and defenders of the system, because we are each
threatened by the same artificial scarcity.</p>

<section id="frustration" class="level2">
<h2>Frustration</h2>
<p>These claims about the issues with modern transportation are not the
typical ones you might hear from transit advocates or cyclists. It is
crucial to understand that Illich’s point is not just a critique of the
inefficiency of large vehicles in an <em>environmental</em> sense
(though he does discuss the wastefulness and pollution of cars), nor in
the sense of <em>public versus private</em> transportation. It is better
understood as a <em>spiritual</em> complaint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if planes and buses could run as nonpolluting, nondepleting
public services, their inhuman velocities would degrade man’s innate
mobility and force him to spend more time for the sake of travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, modern personnel transport is inefficient not because an
individual capsule rather than a cabin is the model for the largest
number of vehicles, or because these vehicles are now owned by their
drivers. It is inefficient because of the obsessive identification of
higher speed with better transport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is practical weight to this spiritual frustration: we spent too
much time commuting. Even still, were we to find some way to have
extremely efficient transportation that reduced commuting time below
that of the old ways, I imagine that Illich would still be unhappy with
the radical monopoly because of its exclusion of nonindustrial
activities.</p>
</section>
<section id="reconstruction" class="level2">
<h2>Reconstruction</h2>
<p>Perhaps we can find ways to specialize the tools of transportation so
that all human uses may be admitted, at all scales. This would likely
require that roads be maintained at a much more granular level than that
of the municipality, and it certainly requires that we depose the
tyranny of cars. A significant chunk of Illich’s book is dedicated to
his thoughts on “convivial reconstruction”—the restructuring of society
to move beyond the contradictions and frustrations of existing tools.
This reconstruction implicates all of society, not just transportation.
The example about fast-moving vehicles is only one part of society in
which this problem rears its head. Illich also laments the consequences
of overefficiency in general, citing its effect on our perception of the
value of time, the creation of time scarcity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The higher we are on the pyramid, the less likely we are to give up
time to simple idleness and to apparently nonproductive pursuits. The
joy of listening to the neighborhood finch is easily overshadowed by
stereophonic recordings of “Bird Songs of the World,” the walk through
the park downgraded by preparations for a packaged bird-watching tour
into the jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today we might recognize this phenomenon in the rampant dissemination
of “self-care” advice on social media, packaged and aestheticized and
medicalized, designed to give you the most bang for your buck in the
contradictory process of slowing down and relaxing.</p>
<p>He makes similar arguments regarding medicine, housing, science,
education, and the law. His reimagining has a massive scope, and his
thoughts on the practical path to conviviality (in politics, justice,
industry, etc.) are numerous and detailed. Perhaps I can write another
post about that part of his book, but here my concerns are more
specific.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-trade-off" class="level2">
<h2>The trade-off</h2>
<p>While the analysis of radical monopoly is astute and I find myself
often thinking about its manifestations in daily life (as in the example
above, which really happened), I do feel that Illich ignores the
essential logic of overefficiency because of an overattachment to the
ways of old.</p>
<p>One can take a different perspective toward the phenomenon of
overefficiency: it is simply the cost of modern life. It is not
difficult to argue that we have gained much more mobility and freedom
than we had preindustrially, <em>and</em> we get to ride on an
upholstered seat in an air-conditioned bus to boot. We trade away some
quaint vision of pastoral life, but we gain so much in its place! We are
surely better off in a globalized world, with the unprecedented
infrastructure of communication (which was to expand dramatically
shortly after the publication of <em>Tools for Conviviality</em>) and
the diversifying economy, the time and money for leisure, the
opportunity to live a totally different life than your ancestors, who
were all farmers for thousands of years. And besides, the rate of
progress would surely indicate we will overcome the spiritual
disadvantages that may ensue, which may, after all, be merely
transitory—growth pains.</p>
<p>And as for the cost, and the simpler, non-industrial activities
precluded by this system? Instead of moving my furniture by hand, I am
compelled, instead, to spend a few dollars consuming an industrial-scale
service that will move it for me. And this is better! It will be fast!
It will be easier! Why would you want to exert all that effort moving it
by hand in the first place?</p>
<p>I do not have a good answer for this, except that I <em>want to</em>.
I want to be <em>able</em> to. It seems to me that the mark of a truly
advanced civilization is one in which, for all our wonderful and
futuristic technology, all our opportunities for sophisticated leisure
and great accomplishments, we can still freely choose to push a cart
down the road. Build a house with our hands and simple tools. Learn from
a book. Take care of a loved one when they are sick. Ride a bicycle.
Listen to the sounds of birds. Sit idly, and daydream.</p>
