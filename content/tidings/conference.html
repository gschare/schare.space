<p><a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH 2024</a> got me thinking
about the research questions I wish I had time to investigate. I feel an
undeniable compulsion to write them down here so that someone can please
please explore them, because I need to see the results (and the field
needs it too)!</p>

<strong>Games for teaching programming</strong>
</summary>
<p>Programming systems are usually complicated and difficult to learn.
Typically, PLs provide learning resources in the form of books and
documentation and possibly a perfunctory tutorial, and perhaps people
create a video series for it. This is kind of okay though—at least in
the case of professional programmers (or computer science students)
learning professional programming tools because it’s their job. But
everyone wants to learn to code these days, and I’m interesting in
creating tools that empower people (e.g.: journalists, scientists,
artists) to program computers without needing professional experience or
a formal computer science education. What if “learning to code” wasn’t
some ambitious side project you had to engage in through serious,
structured, dedicated study, but just the natural process of increasing
your competence in your existing tools? What if there was a way to teach
programming in a more engaging, gradual, and interactive fashion? Video
game designers have to teach players potentially very complex game
mechanics and keep them engaged while doing it. <strong>Can we take
inspiration from video game design in teaching people to use end-user
programming tools?</strong> Games that involve some
computational/automation features, such as Factorio and Minecraft, are
especially of interest here. Regarding Minecraft in particular, I am
interested in stealing the “ponder” feature of the <a
href="https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Pondering">Create mod</a> for use
in end-user programming interfaces.<br />

<strong>Barefoot programmers</strong>
</summary>
<p>In what might be a preference for provocation, I tend to tell people
I want <em>everyone</em> to program—yes, <em>everyone</em>. Really I say
this because I believe everyone deserves the chance to tailor their
tools to their specific needs. Suppose everyone has unique preferences
that could be catered to by a small amount of programming that extends
existing tools (on the level of email filters, or <a
href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/">little ad-hoc apps like
Ink&amp;Switch shows in Potluck</a>). Still, not everyone wants to do
the work of customizing their tools to themselves! They’d rather find
someone else who made something adequate for them. For example, there’s
nothing stopping you from buying your own materials to paint your house,
and a lot of people do it, but also a lot of people hire professionals
to do it. Perhaps a better example is something that doesn’t involve
paid labor, like listening to someone else’s Spotify playlist instead of
making your own. What would this look like in programming?</p>
<p>I want to take inspiration from modding communities of video games.
Professional game developers create modding APIs or even fully-fledged
software development kits for extending their creations. A few hundred
or thousand hobbyist modders with professional or hobbyist programming
and artistic experience then go create mods ranging from simple to very
complex. And the broader community of gamers, which could be many tens
or even hundreds of thousands, <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> use these mods that a
subset of the community created.</p>
<p>See: there are layers to end-user programming. Much like the
“barefoot doctors” from Maoist China <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> discussed in Ivan
Illich’s book <em>Tools For Conviviality</em>, barefoot programmers
could create a (free) marketplace for sharing customized extensions for
any kind of software, but especially their local digital communities. In
other words: journalists will make tools for other journalists; teachers
for other teachers; dentists for dentists; and hyper-niche community
needs can be met by <em>situated software</em> created by people in or
around those communities, so long as for every hundred people there is
one who is trained in very basic programming. Naturally, doing this well
requires programming languages and systems which exhibit a far better
learning/capability curve, which is the whole point of Illich’s book:
the tools must leave the jealous hands of the professionals.</p>
<p>In fact we already see something like this with browser extensions! I
hesitate to lump in mobile app stores and GitHub, though, because the
former requires far too much knowledge and investment from app creators
(and is not based around extending existing tools, unless you count the
phone itself as the tool being extended) and the latter requires too
much knowledge and investment from app users. So, <strong>can existing
multi-layer communities of extensible software provide insights into the
plan for a democratic <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> computational
commons?</strong><br />

<strong>Taxonomy of Programming Tools</strong>
</summary>
<p>Following from <a
href="https://doi.org/10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/13">Technical
Dimensions of Programming Systems</a>, creating a detailed taxonomy of
programming systems is practically irresistible. I have seen diagrams
charting different programming tools on various axes used rhetorically,
but Jakubovic et al present the first attempt (that I am aware of) at a
comprehensive analysis. The next natural question is: <strong>can
taxonomies of programming tools form design guides?</strong></p>
<p>Prior work emphasizes the differences in characteristics between
systems; it seems to me that the most important practical concern—at
least that which a sophisticated taxonomy can help with the most—is the
interoperability between systems. In other words: it is less interesting
how spreadsheets and Smalltalk differ, and more pertinent the limits of
our ability to bridge those technical and conceptual gaps. I am
particularly curious whether <em>reifying the technical and conceptual
dimensions of glue code</em> (rather than sidelining it and trying to
imagine new systems which are designed to be composable from the start)
can provide practical affordances for composing programs. The argument
being: if we let go of the myth that software used to be more
composable, and we let go of the messianic prophecy of a future world
where all systems are designed like Smalltalk, and instead we reify the
world-as-it-is in our architectural models, we can use our existing
techniques for managing abstraction to design more convivial
systems.</p>
<p>Finally, while these attempts at a detailed technical taxonomy are
certainly interesting, there is probably more good that can be done in
the medium of a brief, persuasive essay or talk directed at a general
software engineering audience. The goal is to shift professional
perception of programming tools to better match the long-term vision of
a world full of more situated and more composable tools for programming
computers. Consider my words here as an example of the insufficiency of
poor writing towards swaying opinion…</p>

<h2><a href="#pl">#</a> <span id="pl">The PL Way of Building</span> <a
href="#"></a></h2>
<p>At <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/home/hatra-2024"><span
class="tooltip"
data-title="Workshop on Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants">HATRA</span></a>,
we ended the workshop by discussing some chosen topics in small groups.
I ended up in a group talking about how to systematize tacit PL design
knowledge.</p>
<section id="what-is-tacit-pl-design-knowledge" class="level3">
<h3>What is tacit PL design knowledge?</h3>
<p>A premise I’ve heard many times: PL has knowledge to offer other
areas of computer science, and other fields entirely. This is not some
fringe opinion. Armando, in his Robin Milner Award acceptance address,
said that PL can be thought of as a solution oriented field where we
develop techniques and then find problems to leverage them towards (like
ML and theory do). Formal verification in hardware and security are
great examples of this. I’ve also heard that we can help the databases
community with their problems…</p>
<p>It’s kind of an arrogant thing to say. Wasn’t the lesson of category
theory that various branches of the same field tend to invent their own
language and notation for the same underlying ideas? Wouldn’t the area
of computer science which is most in love with category theory
understand this? Or is that exactly the point: we know other fields have
come up with similar insights, and we are trying to unify our language
so we can understand each other and collaborate better?</p>
<p>To start off the discussion, we attempted to rattle off some of the
things that comprise this tacit PL design knowledge—those things we
value as a research community and which may generalize to other
fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>orthogonality</li>
<li>compositionality</li>
<li>reusable abstractions</li>
<li>local reasoning</li>
<li>correctness</li>
<li>formal reasoning</li>
<li>separation of concerns (i.e. modularity)</li>
<li>canonicity/simplicity</li>
<li>intuition for designing sound type systems</li>
</ul>
<p>We concluded that the “PL approach to solving problems” was the
critical thing, and it consists of a systematic, theory-oriented
approach, where instead of just blowing away the problem all in one, we
develop tools and techniques bit by bit, chipping away at the problem
until it becomes trivialized. We achieve this through proofs and
formalism.</p>
<p>Though I think these particular values are rather specific to the
“types and formalism” side of PL, this side is also the one which seems
to be most eager to spread the gospel of PL with the rest of the world,
so let’s proceed…</p>
</section>
<section id="success-stories" class="level3">
<h3>Success stories</h3>
<p>I asked the group whether they could think of any success stories. We
came up with two:</p>
<ul>
<li>using types in networks to verify router protocols</li>
<li>the UI component model in web programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely there must be more!</p>
</section>
<section id="considerations" class="level3">
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>While composability is one of the PL community’s favorite buzzwords,
enjoying proverbial applause whenever mentioned, we admitted it is not
always a net good. Composability (and immutability) are often in tension
with other desirable properties, like easy-to-follow procedural code,
concreteness (over indirection), and minimal overhead to ensure
performance. In general, if you imagine as a developer you have only a
finite number of tokens to allocate to a piece of software, would you
rather spend them building beautiful, complex, reusable abstractions, or
on practical methods, useful libraries, and documentation? If you think
the former, you may find yourself at home in the PL type theory and
proof assistants community…</p>
<p>In summary: even after a genuine attempt to tease out the value of PL
when applied to other fields, I am unconvinced there is anything
concrete to contribute. Perhaps I just don’t know the real success
stories. Further research is needed.</p>

<section id="taking-an-interest" class="level2">
<h2><a href="#interest">#</a> <span id="interest">Taking an
interest</span> <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>Last section on academic research, I promise! You must understand I
have been getting very immersed in this stuff lately, and SPLASH is like
getting poked by white hot metal, if academic euphoria generates heat.
The weird thing about it is I’m not taking any classes, so that academic
euphoria, to extend the metaphor, has a restricted spectrogram. I get to
have the high-level conversations at lunch with my peers, but I don’t do
the day-to-day “real work” of learning and researching that lends it
meaning. It’s a terrible feeling to come up with an exciting idea and
then <em>not</em> go try to implement it, or to see a talk and then
<em>not</em> continue studying the topic more deeply. Software
engineering has the advantage here, since a big part of my job is to
come up with ideas about how to fix problems or improve our product, and
then go do it.</p>
<p>The result of having pretty much exclusively high-level discussions
about research is I’ve done a lot of soul-searching about why I am
pursuing an academic career and what I hope to achieve by doing computer
science research. Since I’m not in the academy right now (but just on
the periphery of it), this ends up centering not around down-to-earth
technical ideas and research methods, but the value one adds to society
by doing one kind of research or another.</p>
<p>I chatted with Dylan about the importance of marketing your research
to broader and broader audiences, not just for getting grants but
because it’s good to take an interest in your work and your field. We
live in a capitalist society which means, among <a
href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm">other</a>
<a
href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch09.htm">things</a>,
that the primary way you relate to society—and the primary way in which
your worth is evaluated—is through your labor, so you might as well
dignify it. This is especially true if you have such a relatively cushy
and empowering job as software engineering or “professing” in which
professional conferences are a big deal and the third-favorite way of
harming the environment (after using LLMs and living in a first-world
country).</p>
<p>Here’s what it maybe looks like to think through this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am researching type-directed synthesis of pure functional programs
with typed holes.</li>
<li>Because program synthesis helps programmers generate correct code
from specifications, but programmers are reluctant to write
specifications, so we focus on completing incomplete programs, and pure
functional programs are better suited to existing synthesis
techniques.</li>
<li>Because programmers tend to write buggy code, and synthesis helps
write code that is correct (at least type-checks) on the first go.</li>
<li>Because I want software to be more correct.</li>
<li>Because downstream of correctness, on the user-facing side, programs
are more reliable, and on the engineering side, less work is required to
maintain and debug them.</li>
<li>Because software user interfaces are not as good as they could
be</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, as far as things go, actually fairly compelling and
straightforward to my naive eye. It gets a lot more suspect when you’re
working on something that has been tried and failed before, as is the
case for all the people I’ve met this week who fervently believe we
erred in the last century when we didn’t start writing all software (at
least user applications) in Smalltalk. The existential fear there is
that poor programming practices and system designs are so deeply
entrenched in an immovable industry that we will never get rid of the
current, underwhelming software stack. For program synthesis, the
existential fear is that generative AI makes the entire subfield
obsolete.</p>
<p>Most researchers I’ve met seem to think about their work in this way:
there is the specific research they’re doing, which contributes in a
small but significant way to a larger research community, who have a
shared motivation to improve the status quo along some axis
corresponding to a higher-level social or technical goal aligned with
their personal and professional values, which is subject to scrutiny and
skepticism from within and without because the worst thing you can do as
a researcher, next to committing scientific fraud, is spend a lot of
effort working on something that doesn’t matter or doesn’t last.</p>
<p>Once you notice the pattern, the discussions about the significance
of your work become pretty depressing. Worrying about whether your work
matters is not specific to research, let alone programming languages
research in particular, but research uniquely organizes itself
structurally and culturally around the explicit goal of creating lasting
artifacts that contribute to an overarching goal, and failing to do this
is failing to be a good researcher. And, by extension: failing to be a
good member of society, since your worth to the world is your worth in
your work. Even if we admit that failing to obtain positive results is
not really failing as long as you do good work (though scientific
institutions are very bad at creating structures that support this), we
would still be left with a profession in which activities instrumental
to this overall goal are horribly disincentivized.</p>
<p>Consider some cherry-picked cases where important activities other
than generating lasting, impactful artifacts is acknowledged as
important, even if not well-incentivized:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Teachers teach the same material to new students every year, with
gradual modifications year by year as curricula and students’ needs
evolve. They rehearse lectures and recite them; they assign assignments
and grade homework and papers which contain the same distribution of
responses every year. Aside from innovations they might make in their
pedagogy, there is nothing novel about what they are doing. They
contribute to society by sharing their knowledge in structured ways.
They perform a service.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Programmers, we like to think, <em>create</em> software which
lasts a long time and other people use, like a novelist writing a novel
that goes into publication, and then they go write more software. But
this is not actually true most of the time. Programmers less often write
programs, and more often read and debug them. If you squint at the
software industry, it really looks like computer scientists invented
this horribly fussy thing called a computer which runs even more
horribly fussy things like programs which form complicated systems that
society depends on, and programmers exist to manage the onerous task of
keeping these complicated systems running as they break and as their
requirements evolve, and, sometimes, if it hasn’t been done already,
they transform analog bureaucratic systems into software (such as civil
society becoming social media, taxis becoming ride-sharing apps, and any
number of niche services becoming generative AI). There’s an
arbitrariness behind it all—“why don’t the systems just work by
themselves? Why all this tedium?”—that has more in common with than it
does with plumbers than it does with artists or designers or even other
engineers. Programmers perform a service.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/dieworkwear/">menswear guy on
Twitter</a> contributes to society by knowing a lot about fashion, and
using this knowledge to quote-tweet posts containing poor use of fashion
with long, detailed threads breaking down and repeatedly arguing why
fashion is meaningful and interesting and how it is one of the most
significant ways in which we establish and communicate social relations.
When he started, his “thing” was pretty novel, but at this point he has
established his form and yet persists, dutifully, even though he sort of
sounds like a broken record in some cases now. He probably could just
reference old threads to cover almost every case now, but social media
like Twitter is better when it is an active conversation, even if that
conversation involves a recapitulation of old ideas. Menswear guy exists
in a context—a community—and his work is publicly accessible. He is, in
his own way, an educator. He performs a service.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So that’s my thesis: try to conceptualize your work not in terms of
legacy (artifacts entering an archive, with humans accessing and using
that knowledge as an afterthought), but rather as service. As a computer
science researcher, perhaps your primary purpose is to develop
convictions about how something can be improved, gather evidence to back
up your claims, and then spend inordinate time and effort going to
conferences, giving talks, and writing papers and essays in order to
convince your community you are right—and if you do not succeed in doing
that, you are still contributing to society by trying, since there’s
always a chance you were actually wrong the entire time and your ideas
<em>shouldn’t</em> be accepted.</p>
<p>As an effect of this reframing, your worth is defined not just by
your output, and but primarily by your continued presence and
performance. It is more about your inherent worth as a person who exists
in a place and time, in relation to other people, forming a community or
institution.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to read more, because I only have 11 months left to
live (before I go to grad school and become reborn again as a PhD
student). To this end, I finished Dune finally (it only took me 10
years) and I also read Elif Batuman’s two recent novels, <em>The
Idiot</em> and <em>Either/Or</em>. I have nothing to say about this book
that won’t be extremely embarrassing. <a

<section id="the-idiot-and-eitheror" class="level3">
<h3><em>The Idiot</em> and <em>Either/Or</em></h3>
<p>This is not a book review, despite whatever ungenerous thing is
written at the top of the page. “Book review” sounds so impersonal and
critical. My experience reading about Selin’s first two years at college
was deeply personal; I found Selin’s relationship with books reflecting
back at me, commenting metatextually on how I read her story. Especially
in the second volume, Selin begins to think she is going insane as each
book she opens appears to have something uncannily pertinent to say
about what is going on in her life <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I read, the more parallels I found to my own experience. The
emails Ivan and I had exchanged, which had felt like something new we
had invented, now seemed to have been following some kind of
playbook.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A poem in <em>Real Change</em> titled, increasibly, “And to think,
she’d never been kissed.” Was I losing my mind?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of these coincidences are made more extraordinary in the light of
a literature class she attends called Chance, which elevates contingency
to “the royal road to the unconscious.” Even the books she reads appear
to come to her providentially, bearing circumstances and content replete
with meaning. I wrote in the margins, “I recognize pattern and echoes in
Selin recognizing patterns and echoes.” She had the burden of needing to
comb through thousands of pages, of texts classical and prosaic, in
order to find the nuggets of wisdom relevant to her situation; I had the
fortune of finding it all in one convenient <em>bildungsroman</em>.</p>
<p>Of course this is not true. As Selin realizes, the books she reads
don’t give her the answers she is looking for <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.
Frustrated by the limits of literary knowledge, she finds her narrative
apotheosis by abruptly rejecting established narrative, in a conclusion
I found reminiscent of the end of <em>Fleabag</em>. Can you imagine how
that feels to read? It’s like the novel finishes with Selin jumping up
from the page and, boasting her venerably long Goodreads, sagely
informing me that knowledge does not come from books, and actually I
need to stop comparing myself to characters in novels, and go live my
own life. How dare she! What about my great plan to read all these books
really fast?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I didn’t <em>intend</em> to find the answers to life’s
questions by reading books. Batuman’s first novel just grabbed me the
second I started to read it, at a time I really needed a distraction,
and then Selin’s narrative gradually possessed me the same way she is
possessed by the narratives she attaches herself to at Harvard. Too bad
I’m not spending the summer in Hungary or Türkiye. It seems like it
really helped. Anyway, in real life Batuman proceeded, after graduating
from Harvard, to go straight to graduate school where she—you guessed
it—read more books. A <em>lot</em> more books. Everyone who is very
intelligent tells me you can’t learn how to live from books alone, but
they also read several magnitudes more books than I have, even at the
same age as me. Maybe books tell you how to learn from sources other
than books. I’m not sure—and there’s only one way to find out.</p>

<h3><em>Megalopolis</em></h3>
<p>How about movies? Have you seen <em>Megalopolis</em>? People seem to
be regarding it as a triumph, but I think it’s more like a pyrrhic
victory. Yes, it’s a terrifically imaginative and hilarious fever dream
of a film that will hopefully influence mainstream and arthouse cinema
alike forever on… but at what cost?</p>

<h3><em>Dune</em></h3>
<p>I also watched <em>Dune</em> (2021). Uhhh people raved about it for
so long and I built up these great expectations in my mind. Except,
having read the book, I found it slightly disappointing. Don’t get me
wrong: it’s a very good movie… but it’s not a good adaptation of
<em>Dune</em>, the book, and yet I seem to recall everyone suggesting it
was the only faithful adaptation yet committed to screen. The whole
point of adapting <em>Dune</em>, the whole reason it has this legendary
status as impossibly difficult to adapt, is that Herbert does masterful
things with the specific medium of the novel—at a very basic level, many
of the most compelling scenes center around battles of the wits being
fought in the minds of people speaking to each other, given form in the
close-third prose and by writing down characters’ literal thoughts. I
was grateful that Villeneuve didn’t reach for voice-over to adapt this,
but he rather ignored it entirely, and cut out all of the scenes which
hinged on it. Just look, for example, at the meeting of Jessica and
Shadout Mapes. For me, the most interesting parts of <em>Dune</em> (the
book) were those about the Missionaria Protectiva, and I also lovingly
recall the dinner scene in the first part, which was entirely omitted
from the film. I begrudgingly admit that the dinner scene was a good
omission under the constraints of a feature film, but it still makes me
a little sad.</p>
<p><em>Dune</em> (2021) ends up being a pretty good—maybe even
great—epic scifi-fantasy film… but it is not a faithful adaptation. I
think that the problem isn’t Villeneuve’s ability or some inherent
inadaptability of the novel, but the limitations imposed by the
tyrannical hegemony of the feature film. In an age where we enjoy
indulgent streaming-exclusive television miniseries, why would you
choose to mutilate the story to fit the format of mainstream cinema? I
am vindicated, once again, of the genius of <em>Dinotopia</em>.</p>
<p>So <em>Dune</em> (2021) wasn’t that good. But I keep loading it back
up and watching scenes from it, because it just <em>feels</em> so good
to watch. How does that make any sense?</p>

held in place.” The frequency of such ruminations borders on irritating
(and sometimes crosses over), but I found it so charmingly amusing and
embarrassingly relatable; after all, who hasn’t suffered from
infatuations that overstay their welcome? Batuman obviously intended it
to have this effect, so I was not annoyed at <em>her</em> but at the
<em>narrator</em>, which made for a compelling experience of basically
shouting at the page for her to get over him.<a href="#fnref4"

<li id="fn5" role="doc-endnote"><p>I feel dishonest to say that Selin
doesn’t get any wisdom from books. In fact, Breton and the other things
she reads are remarkably important… but not on their own. It’s true that
what they have to offer only becomes crystallized through intentional
action. Far from merely reading the text and becoming enlightened, like
Augustine in the garden, Selin learns her lesson only when the words
bounce around in her mind for months, through a whole Turkish adventure,
and still then only when she decides to do something with it. Now I’ve
been unfair to Augustine: he, too, only earned his revelation after
years of trying. The encounter in the garden was not the singular
moment, but the culmination of thousands of moments.<a href="#fnref5"
