Choosing Season
</title>
<div class="poem">
<ul>
<li>There is a short season just before fall but after summer,
<ul>
<li>where people wear long or short sleeves,</li>
<li>and it is still light out late,</li>
<li>and the plants are still thriving</li>
<li>(though there are hints of yellowed leaves on the ground);</li>
<li>all greens, blues, and greys.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You eat outside in the sun or the shade,
<ul>
<li>regulated by an easy breeze.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The nights are cool but not cold.</li>
<li>This anonymous season enraptures the mind,
<ul>
<li>promising possibility, and lasting,</li>
<li>though in fact much briefer than all other seasons,</li>
<li>seemingly as long as attention permits.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fleeting as it is, the season of choices,
<ul>
<li>when it goes, goes quickly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Take too long to choose
<ul>
<li>(short sleeve or not, inside or out, love or flirt)</li>
<li>and you will be denied its gift:</li>
<li>to be varied and floating, curious</li>
<li>before the ground gets hard.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<!-- lmao cuffing season vs choosing season -->
<ul>
<li>Following the season of choice is the season of instruction.</li>
<li>Where rapid change submits to being led,
<ul>
<li>deferral to the experts in the shadow of sure missteps.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where the committal ones grit their teeth
<ul>
<li>in regret of the choices they made,</li>
<li>and others scramble to secure a place in the early sunset of
scarcity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here is the peril of knowing too much,
<ul>
<li>where expectation comes into contact with reality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cower, waver if you must, but the fault is your own.</li>
<li>You should have known better.</li>
<li>You could have done differently.</li>
<li>Mistake after mistake makes the minutes of your autumn
complete.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tidings/cambridge/d-ivy.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Between these two seasons lies the chasm of missed opportunity.</li>
<li>Go on, confront the question:
<ul>
<li>Rush back and take the path untaken,
<ul>
<li>hoping for greener grass as the grass dies under a white tarp?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or push forth, uncertain and unhappy,
<ul>
<li>recite your lines,</li>
<li>expecting your thermic energy to burn away the chaff</li>
<li>and find the substance in structure?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Or, third, reject forced choices and commit to uncommitting,
<ul>
<li>the easiest way out and the hardest path to follow:</li>
<li>to choose nothing after all?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tidings/cambridge/d-lines.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a script we all follow, hardwired and inevitable.</li>
<li>Frustrating, the process of falling, for the exit sign is
illuminated
<ul>
<li>and no path is identity but one contains it;</li>
<li>if only space was discernible,</li>
<li>maybe these lines would lead to the origin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another thing to do, another assignment to hand it,
<ul>
<li>another lecture to follow, this script lacks imagination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Made still and struck blind,
<ul>
<li>it has become impossible to read the signs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/assets/img/tidings/cambridge/d-spire.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Rest easy knowing at any time you may run away,
<ul>
<li>escape, rushing off into familiar darkness</li>
<li>out of preference for the absence of experience,</li>
<li>knowing nothing alive is there to witness your flight</li>
<li>except for the ear of the infinite, still, and silent night.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
