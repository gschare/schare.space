<!-- [May 16, 2025]{#date} -->
<p>I’ve been confused, or as E likes to call it, indecisive. Since the
better part of five months I have been slowly gathering ideas, fragments
of a theme. Today I was permitted to see the coda, and I had a free
afternoon, so I found my way to decision and I sat down to write…</p>
<p>Following the trend of the titles of these essays/reports/dispatches,
here I present yet another conjunction—in this case, a dichotomy.
Structure and whim. Structure <em>versus</em> whim. I do declare: it
shows up everywhere!</p>
<section id="computational-structure-and-expressivity"
class="level2 return anchor">
<h2 class="return anchor"><a
href="#computational-structure-and-expressivity">#</a> Computational
structure and expressivity <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>I quit my job and took a 5-day trip to visit the love of my life: New
York City. There, between visiting old friends and making new ones, I
attended Omar and Cristóbal’s <a
href="https://screenshot.arquipelago.org/">Screenshot Conf</a>.</p>
<p>Of the many talks that took my breath away, one was on bitmap-first
text editing. A revelation! Of course! Of course! The digital notebook
is a surface for drawing, not a sequence of ASCII characters! It should
be an image!</p>
<p>The merit of plain text is its flexibility. The downside of plain
text is its lack of flexibility. Plain text is an elegantly simple
structure. A text file is just a sequence of bytes with a certain width
that are interpreted as letters. Letters, these discrete, unique
objects, are the foundation of plain text’s delicious harmony between
the linguistic composition of words and their formal structure in the
computer. The engineering tradeoffs of such a basic format prioritize
the gains of simplicity (easy implementation, universality) over the
gains of complexity (structure amenable to computation, potentially
greater expressivity) because the costs of complexity (strong
assumptions about the object and its uses), and, at a deeper level,
clash with the raison d’être of plain text in the first place. Plain
text is basic, must be basic…</p>
<p>Best understood in contrast to rich text and even richer things than
that, plain text doesn’t offer any notion of document structure or
multimedia or spatial relations or font or color or interactivity,
because all of these features—while expanding the possibilities of the
<em>proper</em> use of the format to include richer interpretations of
what “text” might be—<em>constrain</em> the flexibility of its ontology
and shave away the creative potential for abusing it.</p>
<p>It’s exactly that flexibility of ontology implied by the simplicity
of the structure that gives us nice things like HTML, which
<em>does</em> support multimedia… albeit mediated through the concept of
a browser to fetch resources and a web server to provide them. In that
sense the complexity is still there, just shoved to the side…</p>
<p>Low flexibility in <em>format</em> produces high flexibility in
<em>application</em>, at the cost of <em>expressivity</em>… where by
expressivity I mean provisioning a high-level user-facing language,
situated in the specific application context, for interacting with the
system.</p>
<p>In the case of digital notebooks, plain text is not enough because
notebooks are inherently spatial. When writing notes on the computer I
use tools that parse Markdown so I can get the expressivity of document
structure and compute on the text to produce multimedia output, but
still, including things like images and asides is a pain… Introducing
bitmaps… All the visual, spatial elements of notebooks, and none of the
linguistic structure…</p>
<p>Of course you can build hackish algorithms for computing with
text-like bitmaps, in both directions (use the keyboard to type letters
and they will appear as pixels, then detect pixels arranged in the
pattern of text and convert them to ASCII for processing…). And this is
basically similar in spirit to what we’ve done with plain text, building
entire computer systems on the standard via parsing. The fact that this
is possible is a testament to plain text’s ontological flexibility; the
fact that it’s so easy to make mistakes writing “strcutured” text
(e.g. Python programs) is a testament to its poor expressivity.</p>
<!-- May 15, 2025. HTML and the web - a hypertext operating system, structured
  formats but computational, extensible, expressive - allowing whim. -->
<!-- Jun 01, 2025. Recent experiments in computational art:

<p>Since there are two kinds of flexibility here, we should give them
nice names. Let “flexibility” refer to flexibility in format
(i.e. flexibility of structure). As for flexibility in application
(i.e. flexibility of ontology), call it “whim.”</p>
<p>Complex structures, since they encode brittle notions of application,
limit whim. Simple structures encourage whim.</p>
<p>Both bitmap and plain text have rigid, simple structures and permit
whim.</p>

The dialectic of productivity <a href="#"></a></h2>
<p>Whim is sort of like freedom. But the relationship between structure
and whim is not so straightforward in all cases. It’s especially
ambiguous in the case of a conversation you may here between any two
people. It goes like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The One: “I like having a 9-5 job. I need that structure in order to
be productive.”</p>
<p>The Other: “I appreciate flexible hours, because too much structure
makes me anxious and less productive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that is varies, validly, from person to person implies there
is no universal answer, that the relationship between structure, whim,
and productivity is a matter personal self-knowledge. And it’s not even
so simple as preferring one or the other, or a spectrum… What time of
day should be structured and what should be left to whim? What days of
the week? What part of the year? What tasks, what responsibilities? Does
it depend on mood, or energy, or enthusiasm? Solitary versus
collaborative activities?</p>
<p>The Other might argue that structure makes a person complacent and
deadens creative thought. But David Lynch ate the same thing for lunch
every day, claiming that the routine removed a variable—what to eat—that
would otherwise take up space in his working memory that could be
allocated to creativity, i.e. letting the mind and spirit soar to
whimsical heights…</p>
<!-- Steve Jobs' outfit... -->
<p>Under conditions of absolute freedom, do we lose ourselves, tire, and
enter a mode of ignorance and passivity? Or do we seize the pure
potential and sustain a state of pure active direction?</p>
<!-- whether you are more productive with structure or with freedom; this
self-knowledge... -->
<!-- consistency = structure in morning routine, frees thought, chunking,
composition, H on "abstraction" -->
<!-- whim = each moment a new decision, new problem to solve, keeps you in the
driver's seat, active, rajas not tamas, but this is exhausting and can make you

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>Never make your hobbies your job—because that enforces structure on
what should be whimsical.</p>
</section>
<section id="consumerism" class="level3">
<h3>Consumerism</h3>
<p>Before we go on, let me disclaim the cult of productivity pervading
America. When I promote productivity as a good thing, I do not mean you
should prioritize your job unduly. My notion of productivity contrasts
with consumption. Productivity in the sense of “having a job” is, in
fact, consumptive, as opposed to “doing work.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language reflects the monopoly of the industrial mode of production
over perception and motivation. . . . People who speak a nominalist
language habitually express proprietary relationships to work which they
have. All over Latin America only the salaried employees, whether
workers or bureaucrats, say that they have work; peasants say that they
do it: “Van a trabajar, pero no tienen trabajo.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="cite">Ivan Illich, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em>
(1973)</span></p>
<p>(Do not be fooled by Illich’s contradistinction between salaried
workers and peasants; his predictions of the encroachment of consumerist
society into even the non-salaried classes have certainly come to pass
in the age of ubiquitous smartphones.)</p>
<p>I envision a departure from consumerist framing of work, towards a
reconfiguration of productivity as a convivial expansion of creativity,
to include prosocial (but not conventionally or entirely “creative”)
activities such as teaching and other forms of service.</p>

<h2 class="return anchor"><a href="#seasonality">#</a> Seasonality <a
href="#"></a></h2>
<!-- Winter as structured; spring as whim; rites; parties vs organized events -->
<p>It’s trivially obvious to me that winter is a season about structure,
while spring is about whim.</p>
<p>Upon inspection there are fractal subtleties to this. Spring
<em>feels</em> whimsical only because there are <em>structured</em>
events organized to provide opportunities for whim. And winter is
structured in the sense we plan carefully and take our days routinely,
but between the structures of those routines and the long hours spent
inside without the option to frolick outdoors comfortably, there opens
the possibility of a different whim, the straggler’s whim, the
endlessly-extended hangout borne from the circumstance of having nowhere
to be anytime soon.</p>
<p>So here is another case where the dichotomy relates structure and
whim as directly proportional; in other words, structure provides the
possibility of whim. (Surely when events are too structured, whim does
not emerge.)</p>
<p>Then again, winter is when all the event planning and preparation
happens, so in spring and summer we can frolick whimsically. It’s a
matter of perspective.</p>

<h2 class="return anchor"><a
href="#physics-universal-structure-or-divine-whim">#</a> Physics:
universal structure or divine whim? <a href="#"></a></h2>
<!-- May 16, 2025 notes -->
<p>This dichotomy between structure and whim challenges our
understanding of nature. Society seems to take it for granted that
physics—indeed all the natural sciences—obey coherent scientific laws
which can be rendered in mathematics. That this has worked so far—even
as there remain vexing mysteries in cosmology, nuclear physics,
consciousness, and the foundation of mathematics itself—is really a
miracle and we would do well to appreciate that more often.</p>
<p>For most of human history (“since the dawn of time!”), philosophy and
theology have spent significant effort grappling with the assumption
that the universe is inherently <em>unknowable</em>, and then a couple
hundred years ago we all started to realize you could measure and
calculate a lot of things, and you can use those calculations to build
tools that measure and calculate more precisely and more accurately, and
so on. And then Darwin killed God, Oppenheimer harnessed the power to
destroy worlds, we started to do scientific eugenics, etc. etc., we all
know the story and its consequences. So now we all live in an
enlightened world of reason, and all great advancements in science and
technology exploit the knowable structure of the universe, and science
is a process, so this train will just keep on going until we know
everything, control everything.</p>
<p>But then what happened to the conception of the unknowable universe?
And how exactly did we start believing in science?</p>
<p>I’ve hard it argued that religion was invented to provide
explanations for natural phenomena before science was discovered. Thus
casting science as the conclusion to a much longer dark age of reason.
Supposedly, science closed the lid on these old myths, the ones
involving a whimsical God who works in mysterious ways. Turns out that
was just ignorance. Now that we have science, we don’t need religion.
Even your spiritual needs can be upgraded into behavioral psychology,
made manageable with modern medicine, since humans are animals after
all, biological machines that can be mechanistically understood and
repaired and improved.</p>
<p>It’s compelling, this story of religion. Belief in a higher power was
just a stepping stone in anthropological history, but from the moment we
discovered fire we have been on a path to greater and greater knowledge
and power, thanks to our love of reason. And it explains why science
seems to be getting stronger while religion gets weaker. If religion was
always just a crude attempt to understand the natural world, of course
it has evolved to fit the times. Of course we have replaced trickster
deities with benevolent Abrahamic Gods who bestow upon us divine
knowledge of nature and promote reason and structure. The idea (the
hope) that the universe is knowable has always been there, just hidden,
inaccessibly, in the Godhead, until Socrates and St. Augustine and
Einstein <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> revealed the path. Some version of
this is embedded in most world religions. But religious thinking does
contain an unalienable core of faith, which is why we have to move
beyond it and truly embrace science.</p>
<p>So that is the story of religion that science has retroactively
applied to human history. Let us now consider the story of science.</p>
<p>That the history of science portrays frequent, radical refutations of
widely-accepted theories does not contradict the idea of a structured
universe. This story of scientific discovery upholds the validity of the
scientific method, the idea of a convergence on ground truth. Typically
it presumes that such a ground truth exists in the sense that scientific
models can explain and predict natural phenomena, and at the <em>very
least</em> it shrugs its shoulders at the notion of fact, saying that
scientific laws by definition only approximate empirically, and that
science has no opinion on the existence of a fundamentally fathomable
universe. Either way, you operate on the assumption that it works—and it
does work! My question is: aside from the empirical evidence for the
effectiveness of empirical evidence, why do we (epistemologically,
morally, aesthetically) believe the universe has structure in the first
place? <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course not everyone seems to <em>want</em> to believe this. For
one thing, the dominant contact point between science and society these
days is machine learning: a discipline whose most successful
technologies are fundamentally unknowable, each decision from a language
model comes from a “black box.” Or there’s problem that arise in a
purely formal setting, such as <code>P</code> vs <code>NP</code> in
computational complexity, which has the appearance of resisting
apprehension without explanation, except that it <em>feels</em> right
that they are unequal. Another: in the more speculative parts of
physics, you find quasi-scientific reconfigurations of the character of
a capricious God, like the notion that universal constants may change on
us, rendering all our empirical efforts pointless in the face of a
greater logic, one that may remain incalculable. Whether it emerges out
of religious inspiration or inconsistencies within our scientific
theories, there’s something alluring about universal whimsy.</p>
<p>And yet even the idea of an inconstant universe can be fathomed
scientifically, like theories of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-variation_of_fundamental_constants">time-varying
universal constants</a>. Complexity theorists’ inability to resolve
<code>P</code> vs <code>NP</code> may just indicate the immaturity of
our theory of complexity. And on the matter of artificial intelligence,
I have colleagues working hard to apply the science of uncertainty to
machine learning, so we may understand them yet again—albeit in the
regime of probability and statistical inference, the newest turn of
science, guesswork made rational through mathematics, an evolution which
seems to not merely extend science but recontextualize and recast
science itself as a stochastic process. An explanation for everything.
At every dead end, a new unifying theory.</p>

</figure>
<p>So the disagreement on this point, on whether nature is fundamentally
structured or fundamentally whimsical, rages quietly, surfacing only
indirectly, as debates over whether it is even possible to resolve
certain questions in our current frameworks, because the cult of
rationality has placed a taboo, not on not knowing, but on <em>not being
able to know</em>.</p>
<p>Last year we saw the release of <em>Nosferatu</em>, representing our
fear—our reluctant awareness—that there are places in which current
science holds no power, that there are things about reality that only
the occult manages to provide answers, due to a fraught social
epistemology of not-knowing or science’s inherent limitations…. Cinema,
with its remarkable ability to reflect the historical consciousness,
proves that we remain irresolute over the question of natural reason.
The universe <em>is</em> calculable—we know this empirically—but
<em>why</em> is it calculable?</p>
<p>E put it like this: in the year of our (empirically fathomable) lord
twenty twenty-five, the essential question of religion and philosophy is
simply whether you believe in a materialist or non-materialist
basis—basically, does spirit precede expression, or does spirit emerge
from expression?</p>
<p>Our spirit of reason (the belief in a rational world), our expression
of technology (exploiting universal structure). Layering this over our
story of science as the incremental evolution of empirical knowledge
from basic observation to sophisticated engineering, it seems that the
materialist basis is straightforwardly correct, and the other violates
causality. “Surely,” says Heidegger, “technology got under way only when
it could be supported by exact physical science.” Indeed that is
chronologically true, but it misses the historical truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern science . . . pursues and entraps nature as a calculable
coherence of forces. Modern physics is not experimental physics because
it applies apparatus to the questioning of nature. The reverse is true.
Because physics, indeed already as pure theory, sets nature up to
exhibit itself as a coherence of forces calculable in advance, it orders
its experiments precisely for the purpose of asking whether and how
nature reports itself when set up in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="cite">Martin Heidegger, “The Question Concerning
Technology,” in <em>in Martin Heidgger: Basic Writings</em>, ed. David
Farell Krell (1977)</span></p>
<p>While this idea is hardly surprising, it poses again the question:
why would physicists approach nature as a “coherence of calculable
forces”? Though it arrives at universal reason, early science is moved
by faith. “Modern physics is the herald,” Heidegger writes, “whose
origin is still unknown.” Here, “origin” refers not to the literally
earliest conception of the idea, but the rational basis for it, even if
applied retroactively.</p>
<p>Was science handed to us in a Promethean sense? Is it totally
contingent that we happened upon the keys to understanding the universe?
Is it inevitable, extrapolating from the course of anthropological
development, as we settle into agricultural societies and invent money,
which must be counted and calculated, giving us the conceptual tools to
measure, which are then reappropriated by curious proto-scientists who,
both well-fed and unburdened thanks to agrarian surplus, are free to
ponder the mysteries of nature? Is it built into our biology? Or is it
proof of our divine spark, revealing the inner fire leftover from
creation: something that we chose of our free will, not merely accepting
but <em>earning</em> the fruits of technology?</p>
<p>A simple answer: science is only useful if it subscribes to
reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is, as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the
baffling complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events
could be discovered. One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that
two rocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach the
ground at the same time. The laws of nature are concerned with such
regularities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="cite">Eugene Wigner, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of
Mathematics in the Natural Sciences”</span></p>
<p>This is practically a matter of semantics. We have <em>defined</em>
science as the domain of making predictions based on reasonable
assumptions of structure. And yet the miracle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is
something bordering on the mysterious and that there is no rational
explanation for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the <em>fact that science works</em> is the
mysterious part. This hole at the center of our rational donut is
serious enough that an entire field, philosophy of science, concerns
itself with it. But that field, too, rests on structure of a different
kind: philosophical structure of argumentation, perhaps less
compulsively rigorous than mathematics but not so different in its
logical motions, especially in the analytical parts.</p>
<p>It is either a natural inevitability or an incredible stroke of luck
that we have mathematics. Structure or whim. The more you believe in the
structure, the more you start to know. Can whim tell us anything at
all?</p>
<section id="the-great-danger" class="level3">
<h3>The great danger</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In whatever way the destining of revealing may hold sway, the
unconcealment in which everything that is shows itself at any given time
harbors the danger that man may misconstrue the unconcealed and
misinterpret it. Thus where everything that presences exhibits itself in
the light of a cause-effect coherence, even God, for representational
thinking, can lose all that is exalted and holy, the mysteriousness of
his distance. In the light of causality, God can sink to the level of a
cause, of <em>causa efficiens</em>. He then becomes even in theology the
God of the philosophers, namely, of those who define the unconcealed and
the concealed in terms of the causality of making, without ever
considering the essential provenance of this causality.</p>
<p>In a similar way the unconcealment in accordance with which nature
presents itself as a calculable complex of the effects of forces can
indeed permit correct determinations; but precisely through these
successes the danger may remain that in the midst of all that is correct
the true will withdraw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="cite">Heidegger, <em>ibid</em>.</span></p>
<p>Or a great possibility? <a

<blockquote>
<p>re-enchant the world? algorithmic society is completely agnostic to
causal logic. it is entirely about correlation (i.e. you will like this
song because people like you liked it, there is no “reason” per se). we
are returning to magical thinking, anthropologically speaking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a perspective ignores that the data schema of the dataset from
which the machine learns is structured by humans, embedding our rational
biases. There really is a “reason,” even if the reason is obscure—it’s
just very high-dimensional. An odd arrangement: the reason is somewhere
in the data, but inaccessible, like divine knowledge, except in a
reversal of the traditional view of God’s relationship to humanity.
Here, we create the world and god-in-the-machine is the consciousness
interpreting it.</p>
