> We ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is. Everyone

[Heidegger, "The Question Concerning Technology"]{.cite}

Software, entangled with society, challenges its own "merely instrumental,
merely anthropological" definition. Software reveals itself in its dizzyingly high
stakes in the digital age, and in the ourobouric chase of technology and
culture that implicates all human activity. The design of software, then, takes
on a correspondingly weighty role. It behooves us to inquire into the essence of
software.

We will engage with a significant body of primary works in philosophy of design
and technology in order to better understand and critique historical and
contemporary currents of technological thought.
We will analyze the social and political structures that interact dialectically with
technology, investigate the phenomenology of information technology,
and clarify the ethical questions that float heavily today.
By contending with both software engineering doctrine and key philosophical
works, we aim to develop our thinking, provide context for the current moment,
and imagine the design discipline of the future.

> For questioning is the piety of thought.

## September 8 | Introduction
> To think _critically_ about the nature of technology and its role in our
> lives and our society requires, in part, instilling a healthy
> skepticism about two common, unreflective positions on technology: (1) the
> fanatical techno-boosterism of the popular science and technology press, in
> which technology is seen as the key to heaven on earth, and (2) a knee-jerk,
> doom-and-gloom luddism and technology-bashing.
