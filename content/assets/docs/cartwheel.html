<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy canned wet food from any market. Brands e.g. Friskies, 9Lives,
Tastefuls.
<ul>
<li>Give him ~2 5oz cans a day. Lately he has been eating less.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Optionally buy kibble/dry food and treats.</li>
<li>He won’t eat more than he needs, so don’t worry about overfeeding
him.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="water">Water</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep a small bowl of water out. I find he doesn’t often drink water
since the wet food contains enough water for him, but sometimes he
does.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="litter">Litter</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buy any typical bodega litter.</li>
<li>Scoop poop daily.</li>
<li>Change litter and clean box weekly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>He likes to chew cables when he’s understimulated. Just pick him up
and move him away when he does this, or play with him.</li>
<li>He also chews cables, plants, paper and cardboard because it’s good
for his teeth. I have a plant I’ve basically sacrificed to him, and I
let him chew on newspapers and cardboard boxes.</li>
<li>He likes boxes he can sit in.</li>
<li>His carrier is a safe space for him. Leave it out and the door open
so he can go there whenever he wants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t take him outside, at all, ever.</li>
<li>Don’t let him eat food except for his cat food unless you have
checked that it’s safe for cats to eat.
<ul>
<li>Common misconception: cats can’t have dairy. They also can’t have
chocolate, and many fruits are toxic to them, such as grapes and
citrus.</li>
<li>That being said it is a nice treat to occasionally give him some
delicious and safe human food.</li>
