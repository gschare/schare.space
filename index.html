            <p>Apologies: there's not much content on this website (yet). It is a work in progress.</p>
            <p>If you happen to be one of my students, you can find course pages for my summer and fall 2020 CodeAdvantage classes on the <a href="teaching.html">Teaching</a> page. Also feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:g.schare@columbia.edu">g.schare@columbia.edu</a> and let me know what cool stuff you've been up to!</p>
            <p>The About page doesn't exist yet. Don't click it. It will lead you nowhere. Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
            <p>My GitHub link, on the other hand, <em>does</em> exist. Check that out if you're interested in my work on the <a href="https://makingandknowing.org">Making and Knowing Project</a>, <a href="https://columbiaspace.org">Columbia Space Initiative</a>, or <a href="https://gallformers.org">Gallformers</a>.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in hiring me, you can find my resumé <a href="cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            <p>One time I made a <a href="explorers.jpg">photocollage</a> I'm sorta proud of.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>Oh, and what are these fun creatures meandering around the page? Why, they're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids</a>!</p>
